The first integer is the number of test cases. For each test case, the number of digits and the digits themselves are extracted.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we iterate over each digit, increment it by 1, and calculate the product of all digits in the modified array. We keep track of the maximum product obtained.\n3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the results are printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to increment one digit and find the one that maximizes the product. The solution is efficient given the constraints, especially since the number of digits per test case is small (up to 9).",

If `m` is zero, it's impossible to form a palindrome, so we return `False`.\n\n2. **Character Frequency**: We count the frequency of each character in the string.\n\n3. **Odd Count Calculation**: We calculate the number of characters that have an odd frequency. For a string to be rearranged into a palindrome, the number of characters with odd frequencies must be at most one.\n\n4. **Adjusting Odd Count with Removals**: We need to ensure that after removing `k` characters, the number of characters with odd frequencies is at most one. Each removal can reduce the number of odd counts by at most one. Therefore, the minimal number of odd counts after removals is `max(0, odd_count - k)`.\n\n5. **Final Check**: If the minimal number of odd counts after removals is less than or equal to one, it's possible to form a palindrome. Otherwise, it's not.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine the possibility of forming a palindrome after removing `k` characters.",

Additionally, the total number of characters must be at least `m`. We check if the initial odd count is less than or equal to `k + 1` and if `m` is at least 1.\n\n6. **Output**: Based on the above checks, we print \"YES\" or \"NO\" for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if it's possible to form a palindrome by removing exactly `k` characters from the string."

Then follows the description of the test cases.\\n\\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \\\\leq n \\\\leq 10^5$, $2 \\\\leq k \\\\leq 5$) \\u2014 the size of the array $a$ and the number $k$.\\n\\nThe second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n$ ($1 \\\\leq a_i \\\\leq 10$).\\n\\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \\\\cdot 10^5$.\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make the product of all the numbers in the array divisible by $k$.Sample Input 1:\\n15\\n\\n2 5\\n\\n7 3\\n\\n3 3\\n\\n7 4 1\\n\\n5 2\\n\\n9 7 7 3 9\\n\\n5 5\\n\\n5 4 1 2 3\\n\\n7 4\\n\\n9 5 1 5 9 5 1\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n6 3 6\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n6 1 5\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n1 5 9\\n\\n4 4\\n\\n1 4 1 1\\n\\n3 4\\n\\n3 5 3\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n8 9 9 3\\n\\n2 5\\n\\n1 6\\n\\n2 5\\n\\n10 10\\n\\n4 5\\n\\n1 6 1 1\\n\\n2 5\\n\\n7 7\\n\\n\\n\\nSample Output 1:\\n\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n0\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n4\\n0\\n4\\n3\\n\\n\\nNote\\n\\nIn the first test case, we need to choose the index $i = 2$ twice. After that, the array will be $a = [7, 5]$. The product of all the numbers in the array is $35$.\\n\\nIn the fourth test case, the product of the numbers in the array is $120$, which is already divisible by $5$, so no operations are needed.\\n\\nIn the eighth test case, we can perform two operations by choosing $i = 2$ and $i = 3$ in any order. After that, the array will be $a = [1, 6, 10]$. The product of the numbers in the array is $60$.\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

The number of test cases `t` is read first. For each test case, the number of boxes `n` and the list of box weights `a` are extracted.\n\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we iterate over all possible values of `k` (from 1 to `n`). For each `k`, we check if `n` is divisible by `k`. If not, we skip this `k` since it's not possible to divide the boxes into trucks of size `k`.\n\n3. **Calculating Sums**: For each valid `k`, we calculate the sum of weights for each truck. This is done by iterating through the list of weights and summing every `k` elements.\n\n4. **Finding Maximum Difference**: For each set of sums, we find the minimum and maximum sums. The difference between these two sums is the current difference. We keep track of the maximum difference encountered across all valid `k` values.\n\n5. **Output**: After processing all test cases, we print the maximum difference for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to divide the boxes into trucks and find the maximum possible difference in weights between any two trucks.",

Also, keep track of the last parity encountered (`last_parity`).\n2. **Iterate through the array**:\n   - For each element, determine its parity.\n   - If the parity of the current element is the same as the last parity, reset `current_sum` to the current element.\n   - Otherwise, add the current element to `current_sum`.\n   - Update `last_parity` to the current parity.\n   - If `current_sum` exceeds `max_sum`, update `max_sum`.\n   - If `current_sum` becomes negative, reset it to 0 and `last_parity` to `None`.\n3. **Output the results**: After processing all test cases, print the results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we only consider subarrays where the parities of adjacent elements alternate, and it efficiently computes the maximum sum in linear time for each test case.\n\n#### Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the array. Since the sum of n across all test cases is bounded by 2 * 10^5, the overall complexity is acceptable.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space, as we only use a few variables to keep track of the current state.\n\nThis solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",

However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\\n\\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$.

Given that \\(b_i = 2^{a_i}\\) and \\(b_j = 2^{a_j}\\), the condition \\(b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}\\) translates to \\((2^{a_i})^{(2^{a_j})} = (2^{a_j})^{(2^{a_i})}\\). Simplifying this, we get \\(2^{a_i \\cdot 2^{a_j}} = 2^{a_j \\cdot 2^{a_i}}\\), which implies \\(a_i \\cdot 2^{a_j} = a_j \\cdot 2^{a_i}\\).\n\nThis equation holds true in two cases:\n1. When \\(a_i = a_j\\).\n2. When \\(a_i = 1\\) and \\(a_j = 2\\) (or vice versa, but since \\(i < j\\), we only count once).\n\nThus, the solution involves:\n1. Counting the number of pairs where \\(a_i = a_j\\).\n2. Counting the number of pairs where one element is 1 and the other is 2.\n\nThe function `count_valid_pairs` uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the array. It then calculates the number of valid pairs based on the above conditions and returns the total count. The `main` function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.",

The `digit_dp` function computes the count of numbers up to a given number with a digit sum constraint. The `subtract_one` function is used to handle the lower bound by subtracting one from num1 to ensure the range is inclusive. The final result is obtained by subtracting the count of numbers up to num1-1 from the count of numbers up to num2, ensuring the range is correctly handled. The result is then taken modulo 10^9 + 7 to handle large numbers.",

A permutation is semi-ordered if the first element is 1 and the last element is n.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Find Positions**: First, find the positions of the elements 1 and n in the permutation.\n2. **Calculate Swaps**:\n   - If the position of 1 is before the position of n, then the number of swaps required is the sum of the number of swaps needed to move 1 to the first position and the number of swaps needed to move n to the last position.\n   - If the position of 1 is after the position of n, then moving 1 to the first position will automatically move n one position closer to the end. Hence, we subtract one swap from the total.\n\n#### Example Walkthrough:\n- **Example 1**: nums = [2,1,4,3]\n  - pos1 = 1, posn = 2\n  - Since pos1 < posn, swaps = 1 + (3 - 2) = 2\n- **Example 2**: nums = [2,4,1,3]\n  - pos1 = 2, posn = 1\n  - Since pos1 > posn, swaps = 2 + (3 - 1) - 1 = 3\n- **Example 3**: nums = [1,3,4,2,5]\n  - pos1 = 0, posn = 4\n  - Since pos1 < posn, swaps = 0 + (4 - 4) = 0\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum number of swaps required to achieve the semi-ordered permutation.",

We start by assuming the first element of `original` is either 0 or 1. Then, we use the derived array to compute the subsequent elements of `original` using the XOR operation. After reconstructing the `original` array, we check if the last derived value matches the expected value when the last element of `original` is XORed with the first element. If either assumption (starting with 0 or 1) leads to a valid `original` array, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we cover all possible binary configurations for the `original` array and correctly determine if a valid configuration exists that produces the given `derived` array."

For each possible count of walls `j`, we calculate the new count of walls that can be painted if we use the current paid painter. This new count is `min(j + current_time + 1, n)`. We then update the DP value for this new count by taking the minimum of the current value and the cost of using the current paid painter plus the cost to paint `j` walls.\n\n3. **Result**: After processing all walls, the answer is `dp[n]`, which represents the minimum cost to paint all `n` walls.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible combinations of using paid and free painters to minimize the total cost.",

We then update the `dp` array to reflect the new minimum cost for painting a certain number of walls.\n\n3. **Updating the dp array**: For each wall, we iterate through the `dp` array from the end to the beginning to avoid overwriting. We calculate the new number of walls that can be painted if we use the paid painter for the current wall and update the `dp` array accordingly.\n\n4. **Result**: After processing all walls, the value `dp[n]` will contain the minimum cost required to paint all `n` walls.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum cost while considering the constraints of the paid and free painters.",

Conversely, if we increase \\( x \\) by 1 and decrease \\( num \\) by 1, the difference \\( x - num \\) increases by 2.\n\nGiven that we can perform this operation up to \\( t \\) times, the maximum difference we can achieve between \\( x \\) and \\( num \\) is \\( 2t \\). Therefore, the maximum achievable \\( x \\) is:\n\n\\[ x = num + 2t \\]\n\nThis ensures that after performing the operations, \\( x \\) can be adjusted to match \\( num \\). For example, in the first sample input where \\( num = 4 \\) and \\( t = 1 \\), the maximum \\( x \\) is \\( 4 + 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\). Similarly, for the second sample input where \\( num = 3 \\) and \\( t = 2 \\), the maximum \\( x \\) is \\( 3 + 2 \\times 2 = 7 \\).\n\nThus, the solution is straightforward and involves a simple arithmetic operation."

Delete the closest occurrence of c to the left of i (if any) and the closest occurrence of c to the right of i (if any).\\n\\nYour task is to minimize the length of s by performing the above operation any number of times.\\nReturn an integer denoting the length of the minimized string.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"aaabc\\\"\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: In this example, s is \\\"aaabc\\\". We can start by selecting the character 'a' at index 1. We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes \\\"abc\\\". Any further operation we perform on the string will leave it unchanged. Therefore, the length of the minimized string is 3.\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"cbbd\\\"\\nOutput: 3\\nExplanation: For this we can start with character 'b' at index 1. There is no occurrence of 'b' to the left of index 1, but there is one to the right at index 2, so we delete the 'b' at index 2. The string becomes \\\"cbd\\\" and further operations will leave it unchanged. Hence, the minimized length is 3. \\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"dddaaa\\\"\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: For this, we can start with the character 'd' at index 1. The closest occurrence of a 'd' to its left is at index 0, and the closest occurrence of a 'd' to its right is at index 2. We delete both index 0 and 2, so the string becomes \\\"daaa\\\". In the new string, we can select the character 'a' at index 2. The closest occurrence of an 'a' to its left is at index 1, and the closest occurrence of an 'a' to its right is at index 3. We delete both of them, and the string becomes \\\"da\\\".

You can traverse between index i and index j, i != j, if and only if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1, where gcd is the greatest common divisor.\\nYour task is to determine if for every pair of indices i and j in nums, where i < j, there exists a sequence of traversals that can take us from i to j.\\nReturn true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [2,3,6]\\nOutput: true\\nExplanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).\\nTo go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.\\nTo go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1.

This helps in efficiently checking if all indices are connected.\n2. **Prime Factorization**: For each number in the array, we find its prime factors. This is because two numbers share a common factor greater than 1 if and only if they share at least one prime factor.\n3. **Mapping Prime Factors to Indices**: We map each prime factor to the indices of the numbers that contain it. This allows us to connect all indices that share a common prime factor.\n4. **Union Operations**: For each prime factor, we perform union operations on all indices that share that prime factor. This connects all indices that are indirectly connected through shared prime factors.\n5. **Checking Connectivity**: After performing all union operations, we check if all indices are connected to the same root. If they are, it means there exists a sequence of traversals between any two indices, so we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the connectivity of all pairs of indices in the array based on their greatest common divisors."

This helps in determining which elements can follow each other in a permutation.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use a recursive function `dp(mask, last)` with memoization to count the number of valid permutations. The `mask` represents the set of elements already included in the permutation, and `last` is the index of the last element added to the permutation.\n\n3. **Base Case**: If all elements are included in the permutation (`mask == (1 << n) - 1`), we return 1, indicating a valid permutation.\n\n4. **Recursive Case**: For each element not yet included in the permutation, we check if it can follow the last element based on the adjacency list. If so, we recursively count the permutations that can be formed by including this element next.\n\n5. **Initialization and Result Calculation**: We initialize the result by considering each element as the starting point of the permutation and summing the counts of valid permutations starting with each element.\n\n6. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step to ensure it fits within the required constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid special permutations using dynamic programming and memoization, leveraging the constraints provided."

We maintain two arrays, `dp1` and `dp2`, where:\n- `dp1[i]` represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at index `i` when `nums3[i]` is chosen as `nums1[i]`.\n- `dp2[i]` represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at index `i` when `nums3[i]` is chosen as `nums2[i]`.\n\nFor each index `i`, we update `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]` based on the values of `nums1[i]`, `nums2[i]`, `nums1[i-1]`, and `nums2[i-1]`. Specifically:\n- If `nums1[i]` is chosen, we check if it can extend the subarray ending at `i-1` when `nums3[i-1]` was `nums1[i-1]` or `nums2[i-1]`.\n- Similarly, if `nums2[i]` is chosen, we check if it can extend the subarray ending at `i-1` when `nums3[i-1]` was `nums1[i-1]` or `nums2[i-1]`.\n\nFinally, the result is the maximum value in `dp1` and `dp2`, which represents the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in `nums3`.",

Specifically:\n   - If `nums1[i]` is greater than or equal to `nums1[i-1]`, we can extend the subarray ending at `i-1` when `nums3[i-1]` was `nums1[i-1]`.\n   - Similarly, if `nums1[i]` is greater than or equal to `nums2[i-1]`, we can extend the subarray ending at `i-1` when `nums3[i-1]` was `nums2[i-1]`.\n   - The same logic applies for `dp2[i]` when `nums3[i]` is `nums2[i]`.\n\n3. **Max Length Update**: After updating `dp1[i]` and `dp2[i]`, we update the `max_len` to be the maximum value between the current `max_len`, `dp1[i]`, and `dp2[i]`.\n\n4. **Result**: Finally, we return `max_len` as the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray in `nums3`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible choices for `nums3[i]` at each step and efficiently compute the longest non-decreasing subarray.",

For example, \\\"aa\\\", \\\"aba\\\", \\\"adbgad\\\", and, \\\"abab\\\" are semi-palindrome and \\\"a\\\", \\\"ab\\\", and, \\\"abca\\\" are not.\\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\\n\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"abcac\\\", k = 2\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation: We can divide s into substrings \\\"ab\\\" and \\\"cac\\\". The string \\\"cac\\\" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change \\\"ab\\\" to \\\"aa\\\", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.\\nIt can be shown that there is no way to divide the string \\\"abcac\\\" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"abcdef\\\", k = 2\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \\\"abc\\\" and \\\"def\\\". Each of the substrings \\\"abc\\\" and \\\"def\\\" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.\\nIt can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"aabbaa\\\", k = 3\\nOutput: 0\\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \\\"aa\\\", \\\"bb\\\" and \\\"aa\\\".\\nThe strings \\\"aa\\\" and \\\"bb\\\" are already semi-palindromes.

If any of these substrings is in the forbidden set, we move the `left` pointer to just after the start of that substring.\n4. **Updating Maximum Length**: After ensuring the current substring is valid, we update the maximum length of valid substrings found so far.\n5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the maximum length of the valid substring found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for forbidden substrings while maintaining the sliding window to find the longest valid substring.",

The window is defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`.\n\n3. **Adjusting the Window**: For each element at position `right`, we calculate the minimum and maximum possible values it can take after applying the operation. We then adjust the `left` pointer to ensure that all elements in the current window can be adjusted to the same value within the range `[min_val, max_val]`.\n\n4. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty of the current window is the number of elements in it (`right - left + 1`). We keep track of the maximum beauty found so far.\n\n5. **Returning the Result**: After processing all elements, we return the maximum beauty found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subsequence where all elements can be adjusted to the same value, using a combination of sorting and a sliding window technique.",

This gives us a list of intervals.\n2. **Sorting**: Sort these intervals based on their start values. This helps in efficiently finding overlapping intervals.\n3. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window approach to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals. The idea is to maintain a window where all intervals overlap with each other. If the current interval does not overlap with the leftmost interval in the window, move the left pointer to the right.\n4. **Max Beauty**: The size of the largest window where all intervals overlap gives the maximum possible beauty of the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by replacing them within their respective ranges. The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), which is suitable given the constraints.",

We consider an array good if it is a permutation of an array base[n].\\nbase[n] = [1, 2, ..., n - 1, n, n] (in other words, it is an array of length n + 1 which contains 1 to n - 1 exactly once, plus two occurrences of n).

Depending on the parity of `nums[0]`, we set the corresponding `dp_even` or `dp_odd` value to `nums[0]`.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each position `i` in the array:\n   - If the current number is even, we update `dp_even[i]` by considering the maximum of the previous `dp_even` value and the previous `dp_odd` value minus `x` (since we are switching parity), and then adding the current number.\n   - Similarly, if the current number is odd, we update `dp_odd[i]` by considering the maximum of the previous `dp_odd` value and the previous `dp_even` value minus `x`, and then adding the current number.\n4. **Result**: The maximum score is the maximum value between `dp_even[-1]` and `dp_odd[-1]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible sequences of moves while accounting for the penalty when switching between even and odd numbers.",

This simplifies the problem to finding subarrays where the sum of the binary array elements modulo `modulo` equals `k`.\n\n2. **Prefix Sum Approach**: We use a prefix sum approach to efficiently count the number of subarrays that satisfy the condition. We maintain a running sum of the binary array and use a hash map (`prefix_map`) to store the frequency of each prefix sum modulo `modulo`.\n\n3. **Counting Subarrays**: For each element in the binary array, we update the prefix sum. We then calculate the target value `(prefix_sum - k) % modulo` and check if this target exists in the `prefix_map`. If it does, it means there are subarrays ending at the current index that satisfy the condition, so we add the frequency of the target to the count.\n\n4. **Updating Prefix Map**: After processing each element, we update the `prefix_map` with the current prefix sum modulo `modulo`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all interesting subarrays in linear time, making it suitable for the given constraints.",

The key insight is to sort the `usageLimits` and then iteratively check if we can form groups of increasing sizes.\n\n1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `usageLimits` array. This allows us to use the smallest limits first, ensuring that we can form as many groups as possible.\n\n2. **Iterative Check**: Initialize `total` to keep track of the cumulative sum of the usage limits and `k` to count the number of groups. For each limit in the sorted array, add it to `total`. Then, check if `total` is at least the sum of the first `k+1` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `(k+1)*(k+2)//2`. If it is, increment `k`.\n\n3. **Result**: The value of `k` at the end of the iteration represents the maximum number of groups that can be formed under the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use the available limits to form the maximum number of groups while satisfying the conditions.",

The key is to ensure that each group has a strictly increasing size and that the usage limits of each number are not exceeded.\n\n1. **Sorting the Usage Limits**: First, we sort the `usageLimits` array. This allows us to consider the smallest limits first, ensuring that we can form as many groups as possible without running out of available numbers early.\n\n2. **Calculating the Total Usage**: We maintain a running total of the usage limits. For each number, we add its limit to this total.\n\n3. **Determining the Number of Groups**: We check if the current total can support forming another group. The size of the next group must be one more than the previous group. The total number of elements required to form `k` groups is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is given by the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If the total usage is at least this value, we can form another group.\n\n4. **Returning the Result**: We continue this process until we can no longer form a new group, and then return the count of groups formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of groups while adhering to the constraints on the usage limits and the increasing size of the groups."

This helps in efficiently checking and counting pairs.\n\n2. **Iterating Through Coordinates**: For each unique coordinate `(x1, y1)`, we iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` such that `a + b = k`. This is because the distance condition `(x1 XOR x2) + (y1 XOR y2) = k` can be broken down into `a = x1 XOR x2` and `b = y1 XOR y2`.\n\n3. **Calculating Potential Pairs**: For each `a` and `b`, we calculate the potential `(x2, y2)` using the XOR operation. If `(x2, y2)` exists in the frequency map, we count the valid pairs.\n\n4. **Handling Same Points**: If `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` are the same, we need to count the number of ways to choose 2 points from `cnt1` points, which is `cnt1 * (cnt1 - 1) // 2`.\n\n5. **Avoiding Double Counting**: To avoid counting pairs twice, we only count pairs where `x1 < x2` or `(x1 == x2 and y1 < y2)`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid pairs without redundant calculations.",

This helps in efficiently counting pairs later.\n\n2. **Iterating Through Points**: We then iterate through all unique pairs of points. For each pair, we calculate the distance using the given formula: `(x1 XOR x2) + (y1 XOR y2)`.\n\n3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: If the calculated distance equals `k`, we count the valid pairs:\n   - If the pair consists of the same point, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 points from the frequency count using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.\n   - If the pair consists of different points, we multiply their frequencies to get the total number of valid pairs.\n\n4. **Returning the Count**: Finally, we return the total count of valid pairs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all pairs that satisfy the given distance condition, leveraging the frequency map to avoid redundant calculations."

The goal is to minimize the length of the array after performing such operations as many times as possible.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer starts at the beginning of the array, and the `right` pointer starts at the middle of the array. This is because we want to pair elements from the first half with elements from the second half.\n\n2. **Pairing Elements**: We iterate through the array using these two pointers. For each pair of elements where `nums[left] < nums[right]`, we increment the `pairs` counter and move both pointers forward. This means we have successfully removed a pair of elements.\n\n3. **Handling Unpaired Elements**: If `nums[left]` is not less than `nums[right]`, we only move the `right` pointer forward. This is because the current `left` element cannot be paired with the current `right` element, so we try to pair it with a later element.\n\n4. **Calculating the Result**: After processing all possible pairs, the minimum length of the array is the original length minus twice the number of pairs formed. This is because each pair removes two elements from the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of pairs removed, thus minimizing the final length of the array.

This gives us a dictionary where keys are the numbers and values are their counts.\n\n2. **Handling Each Count**: For each number, we determine the minimum number of operations required to remove all instances of that number:\n   - If the count is 1, it's impossible to remove it using the given operations, so we return -1.\n   - We try to use as many 3-operations as possible because they are more efficient (removing 3 elements in one operation).\n   - If the remainder after dividing by 3 is 1, we need to adjust by converting one 3-operation into two 2-operations.\n   - If the remainder is 2, we simply add one 2-operation.\n\n3. **Summing Operations**: We sum the operations required for each number to get the total number of operations needed to empty the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we use the minimum number of operations efficiently and handle edge cases appropriately."

If no valid subarray is found, return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray that meets the target sum, considering the infinite nature of the array."

For each group size, we check if it can be used to form valid groups for all frequencies.\n4. **Validation**: For each frequency, we calculate the number of groups needed and the remainder. If the remainder is greater than the number of groups, the group size is invalid. Otherwise, we continue to the next frequency.\n5. **Total Groups Calculation**: If a group size is valid for all frequencies, we calculate the total number of groups needed and return it.\n6. **Fallback**: If no valid group size is found, we return the number of distinct frequencies as the minimum number of groups.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum number of groups required to satisfy the given conditions.",

If not, it's impossible to make them equal, so we return -1.\n4. **One Array Has No Zeros**: If one array has no zeros, its sum must be greater than or equal to the sum of the other array plus the number of zeros in the other array. If not, it's impossible to make them equal, so we return -1. Otherwise, we return the sum of the array with no zeros.\n5. **Both Arrays Have Zeros**: If both arrays have zeros, the minimum possible sum is the maximum of `(sum1 + count1)` and `(sum2 + count2)`. This is because each zero must be replaced by at least 1, and we need to ensure that both arrays can reach the same sum by replacing their zeros.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the minimum possible equal sum or determine if it's impossible to make the sums equal.",

A subsequence is balanced if for every pair of consecutive elements in the subsequence, the difference between the elements is at least the difference between their indices.\n\nTo solve this, we transform the problem by considering the value `nums[i] - i` for each index `i`. The condition for the subsequence to be balanced then becomes that the transformed values must be non-decreasing. This allows us to use dynamic programming with a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) to efficiently manage and query the maximum sums.\n\n1. **Transformation**: For each index `i`, compute `nums[i] - i`. This transforms the problem into finding a subsequence where these transformed values are non-decreasing.\n2. **Compression**: Since the transformed values can be large, we compress them into a smaller range by mapping each unique transformed value to a unique index.\n3. **BIT Initialization**: Initialize a BIT to keep track of the maximum sums for each compressed index.\n4. **DP with BIT**: For each element in the array, compute the maximum sum that can be achieved up to that point by querying the BIT for all transformed values less than or equal to the current transformed value. Update the BIT with the new maximum sum.\n5. **Result**: The result is the maximum sum found during the process.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum of a balanced subsequence while handling the constraints effectively.",

The number of swaps required for each '0' is equal to the number of '1's to its left.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n1. Initialize `total` to keep track of the total number of swaps.\n2.

Traverse the string from left to right.\n2. Keep a count of the number of black balls encountered so far.\n3. For each white ball encountered, add the current count of black balls to the total number of swaps required. This is because each white ball needs to be swapped with all the black balls to its left to move it to the leftmost position.\n\nThis approach ensures that we calculate the minimum number of swaps efficiently in a single pass through the string, making it optimal with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\nFor example, consider the string \"100\":\n- Initialize `total = 0` and `black_count = 0`.\n- At index 0, s[0] = '1': increment `black_count` to 1.\n- At index 1, s[1] = '0': add `black_count` (1) to `total`, so `total = 1`.\n- At index 2, s[2] = '0': add `black_count` (1) to `total`, so `total = 2`.\nThus, the minimum number of swaps required is 2, which matches the example provided."

This allows us to consider elements in a sequence and easily calculate the cost to make a window of elements equal to the last element in the window.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of elements that can be made equal with at most `k` operations. The window is defined by the indices `left` and `right`.\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**: For each window, we calculate the total number of operations required to make all elements in the window equal to `nums[right]`. This is given by the formula `(right - left + 1) * nums[right] - total`, where `total` is the sum of the elements in the window.\n\n4. **Adjusting the Window**: If the cost exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to the right to reduce the window size and the cost.\n\n5. **Max Frequency**: We keep track of the maximum window size that satisfies the cost constraint, which represents the maximum frequency of any element after performing the operations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum possible frequency of any element in the array after performing at most `k` operations.",

Each operation allows us to increment or decrement an element by 1. The key insight is that to maximize the frequency of a particular element, we should try to make as many elements as possible equal to that element with the minimum number of operations.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps in easily calculating the number of operations required to make a range of elements equal to a target element.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window approach to consider different ranges of elements. For each window, we calculate the number of operations needed to make all elements in the window equal to the last element in the window (since the array is sorted, the last element is the largest in the window).\n\n3. **Calculate Operations**: The number of operations required to make all elements in the window equal to the last element is given by the formula: `(window_size) * nums[right] - sum_of_window`. If this value is greater than `k`, we need to shrink the window from the left.\n\n4. **Maximize Frequency**: We keep track of the maximum window size (frequency) that can be achieved with at most `k` operations.\n\nBy following this approach, we ensure that we efficiently find the maximum possible frequency of any element in the array after performing the allowed operations.\n\nThe provided code implements this logic using a sorted array and a sliding window to find the optimal solution.",

This helps in determining the boundaries of the segments where no number repeats.\n2. **Segment Determination**: We iterate through the array, updating the `end` variable to the maximum of its current value and the last occurrence of the current number. This ensures that we are considering the farthest point where the current segment can end without repeating any number.\n3. **Counting Partitions**: When we reach the end of a segment (i.e., `idx == end`), we multiply the result by 2, as we have two choices: either to end the segment here or to continue. We also take modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) to handle large numbers.\n4. **Final Adjustment**: Since we multiply by 2 for each segment, but the last segment does not need to be multiplied, we divide the final result by 2 to get the correct count of good partitions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible good partitions while handling the constraints effectively.",

The window is expanded by moving the right pointer and contracted by moving the left pointer.\n3. **Count Maximum Elements**: Keep track of the count of the maximum element within the current window.\n4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: When the count of the maximum element in the window reaches or exceeds `k`, all subarrays ending at the current right pointer and starting from the current left pointer to any position before the right pointer are valid. Increment the count of valid subarrays accordingly.\n5. **Adjust the Window**: Move the left pointer to the right to try to find new valid subarrays.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid subarrays in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes."

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning.

The child at position 2 gets infected.\\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4.

The idea is to maintain a window of elements where the frequency of each element is at most `k`. We use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each element in the current window.\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to 0. Also, initialize a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window. Set `max_len` to 0 to store the length of the longest good subarray found so far.\n\n2. **Expand the window**: Move the `right` pointer to include a new element in the window. Update the frequency of this element in the `freq` dictionary.\n\n3. **Shrink the window if necessary**: If the frequency of the newly added element exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right to exclude elements from the window until the frequency of the element is back to `k` or less. Update the frequencies in the `freq` dictionary accordingly.\n\n4. **Update the maximum length**: After ensuring the window is valid, update `max_len` with the length of the current window if it is greater than the previous `max_len`.\n\n5. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the `right` pointer has traversed the entire array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest subarray where each element's frequency is at most `k`, using a single pass through the array with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array."

If such a number is found, we add the smallest missing coin to the set and update the reachable sum. This process continues until the target is reachable.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Sort the Coins**: Start by sorting the given coins in ascending order.\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Use `max_reachable` to keep track of the largest sum that can be formed with the current set of coins. Initialize `added_coins` to count the number of coins added.\n3. **Iterate Through Coins**: For each coin, if it is less than or equal to `max_reachable + 1`, it can be used to extend the reachable sum. Otherwise, we need to add a new coin (specifically, `max_reachable + 1`) to cover the gap.\n4. **Update Reachable Sum**: After processing each coin or adding a new coin, update `max_reachable` accordingly.\n5. **Repeat Until Target is Reached**: Continue the process until `max_reachable` is at least as large as the target.\n\nThis method ensures that we efficiently cover all integers up to the target with the minimum number of additional coins.",
        "```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumAddedCoins(self, coins: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        coins.sort()\n        max_reachable = 0\n        added_coins = 0\n        i = 0\n        n = len(coins)\n        \n        while max_reachable < target:\n            if i < n and coins[i] <= max_reachable + 1:\n                max_reachable += coins[i]\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                added_coins += 1\n                max_reachable += max_reachable + 1\n        \n        return added_coins\n\n\n```\n\n\n### Explanation\nThe problem requires us to determine the minimum number of coins to add to the given array such that every integer from 1 to the target can be obtained as a sum of some subsequence of the coins. The key insight is to use a greedy approach to iteratively build the range of obtainable sums.\n\n1. **Sorting**: First, sort the coins in ascending order. This allows us to process the smallest coins first, which helps in building the range of obtainable sums efficiently.\n\n2. **Initialization**: Initialize `max_reachable` to 0, which represents the maximum sum that can be obtained with the current set of coins. Also, initialize `added_coins` to 0 to keep track of the number of coins added.\n\n3. **Iterating through coins**: Use a while loop to iterate until `max_reachable` is less than the target. Inside the loop:\n   - If the current coin is less than or equal to `max_reachable + 1`, it means we can extend the range of obtainable sums by adding this coin. Update `max_reachable` by adding the value of the current coin.\n   - If the current coin is greater than `max_reachable + 1`, it means there is a gap in the range of obtainable sums. To fill this gap, add a coin of value `max_reachable + 1` to the array and update `max_reachable` accordingly.

For each coin, if it is less than or equal to `max_reachable + 1`, it means we can extend the range of obtainable sums by adding this coin. We update `max_reachable` by adding the value of the current coin.\n4. **Adding coins**: If the current coin is greater than `max_reachable + 1`, it means there is a gap in the obtainable sums. To fill this gap, we add a coin of value `max_reachable + 1` and update `max_reachable` accordingly. We increment the `added_coins` counter.\n5. **Termination**: The loop continues until `max_reachable` is at least `target`. At this point, all sums from 1 to `target` are obtainable, and we return the count of added coins.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently fill the gaps in the obtainable sums with the minimum number of additional coins."

If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.\\nNote that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: source = \\\"abcd\\\", target = \\\"acbe\\\", original = [\\\"a\\\",\\\"b\\\",\\\"c\\\",\\\"c\\\",\\\"e\\\",\\\"d\\\"], changed = [\\\"b\\\",\\\"c\\\",\\\"b\\\",\\\"e\\\",\\\"b\\\",\\\"e\\\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]\\nOutput: 28\\nExplanation: To convert the string \\\"abcd\\\" to string \\\"acbe\\\":\\n- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.\\n- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.\\n- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.\\n- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.\\nThe total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.\\nIt can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.\\n\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: source = \\\"aaaa\\\", target = \\\"bbbb\\\", original = [\\\"a\\\",\\\"c\\\"], changed = [\\\"c\\\",\\\"b\\\"], cost = [1,2]\\nOutput: 12\\nExplanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.\\n\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: source = \\\"abcd\\\", target = \\\"abce\\\", original = [\\\"a\\\"], changed = [\\\"e\\\"], cost = [10000]\\nOutput: -1\\nExplanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.\\n\\n \\nConstraints:\\n\\n1 <= source.length == target.length <= 10^5\\nsource, target consist of lowercase English letters.\\n1 <= cost.length == original.length == changed.length <= 2000\\noriginal[i], changed[i] are lowercase English letters.\\n1 <= cost[i] <= 10^6\\noriginal[i] != changed[i]\\n\\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\\n```python\\nclass Solution:\\n    def minimumCost(self, source: str, target: str, original: List[str], changed: List[str], cost: List[int]) -> int:\\n        \\n```\\n\\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\\n\\n\"}]": [

We ensure that if multiple costs exist for the same transformation, we keep the minimum cost.\n2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For each character, we use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the minimum cost to transform it to every other character. This gives us a dictionary `min_cost` where `min_cost[char]` is a dictionary of the minimum costs to transform `char` to other characters.\n3. **Cost Calculation**: For each character in `source` and `target`, we check if the transformation is possible using the `min_cost` dictionary. If any transformation is not possible, we return -1. Otherwise, we sum up the costs of all transformations.\n4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the total cost if all transformations are possible, otherwise, we return -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum cost to transform `source` to `target` using the given transformations and their costs.",

So the sum of the prices of the first 6 numbers is 9.\\nSo the answer is 6.\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: k = 7, x = 2\\nOutput: 9\\nExplanation: Since x is equal to 2, we should just check even^th bits.\\nThe second bit of binary representation of numbers 2 and 3 is a set bit.

So the sum of their prices is 2.\\nThe fourth bit of binary representation of numbers 8 and 9 is a set bit but their second bit is not. So the sum of their prices is 2.\\nNumbers 1, 4, and 5 don't have set bits in their even^th bits in their binary representation. So the sum of their prices is 0.\\nThe second and the fourth bit of the binary representation of the number 10 are a set bit.

This is because the least significant bit (LSB) of an even number is 0. When we perform a bitwise OR operation on two or more numbers, the result will be even if at least one of the numbers is even. However, to ensure that the result has at least one trailing zero, we need at least two even numbers. This is because the OR of two even numbers will definitely be even (since both have their LSB as 0), whereas the OR of one even and one odd number will be odd (since the odd number has its LSB as 1).\n\nTherefore, the solution involves counting the number of even numbers in the array. If there are at least two even numbers, we can select them to ensure that their bitwise OR has at least one trailing zero. Otherwise, it is not possible.\n\nThe code counts the number of even numbers in the list and checks if this count is at least two. If so, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.",

This is because the least significant bit (LSB) of the result will be 0 if at least one of the operands has an LSB of 0.\n\n2. **Binary Representation**: A number has a trailing zero in its binary representation if it is even. This is because even numbers are divisible by 2, and their binary representation ends with a 0.\n\nGiven these properties, the problem reduces to checking if there are at least two even numbers in the array. If there are, we can select any two of them, and their bitwise OR will have at least one trailing zero.\n\n### Approach\n1. Count the number of even numbers in the array.\n2. If the count is at least two, return `True`.\n3. Otherwise, return `False`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def hasTrailingZeros(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:\n        # Count the number of even numbers in the list\n        even_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num % 2 == 0)\n        # If there are at least two even numbers, return True\n        return even_count >= 2\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n1. **Counting Even Numbers**: The code uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count how many numbers in the list are even. This is done by checking if the number modulo 2 equals 0.\n2. **Condition Check**: After counting the even numbers, the code checks if the count is at least 2. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that it is possible to select two or more elements whose bitwise OR has at least one trailing zero. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and easy to understand, leveraging the properties of even numbers and the bitwise OR operation.",

You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).\\nReturn true if you can sort the array, else return false.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]\\nOutput: true\\nExplanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element. The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation \\\"10\\\", \\\"100\\\", and \\\"1000\\\" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation \\\"1111\\\" and \\\"11110\\\".\\nWe can sort the array using 4 operations:\\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].\\n- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].\\n- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].\\n- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each.

Positions**: It identifies the indices of all '?' characters in `S`.\n3. **Base Value Calculation**: It calculates the base value by replacing all '?' with '0' and converting the result to a binary integer.\n4. **Check Base Value**: If the base value is already greater than `N`, it prints `-1` and exits.\n5. **Maximizing Value**: It iterates over the '?' positions in descending order of their bit significance. For each '?', it checks if setting it to '1' would keep the value within `N`. If so, it updates the value.\n6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the maximum value found that is less than or equal to `N`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum possible value without generating all possible combinations, which would be computationally infeasible for large strings.",

Convert this to a binary integer.\n3. **Check Feasibility**: If this base number is already greater than `N`, print `-1` and exit.\n4. **Greedy Maximization**: Iterate over the positions of `?` from the most significant to the least significant. For each position, try to replace `0` with `1` and check if the new number is still less than or equal to `N`. If it is, keep the `1`; otherwise, revert to `0`.\n5. **Final Result**: After processing all `?` positions, the resulting binary string represents the maximum possible number less than or equal to `N`. Convert this to a decimal integer and print it.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest possible number in `T` that is less than or equal to `N` without generating all possible combinations, which would be computationally infeasible for large strings.",

The string `S` contains characters '0', '1', and '?'. The integer `N` is the upper limit for the values we are considering.\n\n2. **Question Indices**: We first identify the indices of all '?' characters in the string `S`. These are the positions that can be replaced with either '0' or '1'.\n\n3. **Greedy Approach**: We use a greedy approach to replace each '?' with '1' if it does not cause the resulting binary number to exceed `N`. If replacing a '?' with '1' would make the number exceed `N`, we replace it with '0' instead.\n\n4. **Final Check**: After processing all '?' characters, we convert the final binary string to a number and check if it is less than or equal to `N`. If it is, we print the number.

The string `S` contains characters '0', '1', and '?'. The integer `N` is the upper limit for the values we are interested in.\n\n2. **Finding Positions of '?'**: We first identify the indices of all '?' characters in the string `S`. These positions will be replaced with either '0' or '1' to generate all possible binary strings.\n\n3. **Generating All Possible Combinations**: For each possible combination of '0' and '1' for the '?' positions, we construct a binary string. This is done by iterating over all possible bit masks for the '?' positions.\n\n4. **Converting to Integer**: Each generated binary string is converted to a decimal integer.\n\n5. **Checking Against N**: We check if the integer is less than or equal to `N`. If it is, we keep track of the maximum such integer.\n\n6. **Output**: After evaluating all combinations, we print the maximum valid integer. If no valid integer is found, we print `-1`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible replacements for '?' and find the largest valid number that is less than or equal to `N`.\n\n### Example Walkthrough\n\nFor the sample input `?0?` and `N = 2`:\n- The '?' positions are at indices 0 and 2.\n- Possible combinations:\n  - Replace '?' with '0' and '0': '000' \u2192 0\n  - Replace '?' with '0' and '1': '001' \u2192 1\n  - Replace '?' with '1' and '0': '100' \u2192 4\n  - Replace '?' with '1' and '1': '101' \u2192 5\n- Valid numbers \u2264 2: 0 and 1\n- Maximum valid number: 1\n\nThus, the output is `1`."

The DP state `dp[mask][u]` represents the minimum number of moves to reach position `u` with the set of candies collected represented by `mask`.\n\n6. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of candies that can be collected while reaching the goal within \\( T \\) moves is determined by iterating over all possible masks and checking the corresponding DP values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of candies that can be collected while adhering to the move constraint.",

This is done using the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices.\n4. **Maximizing the Sum**: For each valid pair (a, b), we check if their sum is greater than the current maximum sum and update the maximum sum accordingly.\n5. **Output**: After processing all elements in A, the maximum sum is printed. If no valid pair is found, -1 is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the pair of gifts that maximizes the sum while keeping the difference within the specified limit.",

We describe the moves below.\\n\\n- \\n1-st move: S_i is R, so he moves to point (1,0).  His health reduces to 2.  Although an item is placed at point (1,0), he do not consume it because his health is no less than K=1.\\n\\n- \\n2-nd move: S_i is U, so he moves to point (1,1).  His health reduces to 1.\\n\\n- \\n3-rd move: S_i is D, so he moves to point (1,0).  His health reduces to 0.  An item is placed at point (1,0), and his health is less than K=1, so he consumes the item to make his health 1.\\n\\n- \\n4-th move: S_i is L, so he moves to point (0,0).

The number of moves `N`, the number of items `M`, initial health `H`, and the health threshold `K` are extracted. The string `S` representing the moves is also read. The positions of the items are stored in a set for quick lookup.\n\n2. **Simulating Moves**: Starting from the initial position (0, 0), each move is simulated. The position is updated based on the move direction, and the health is decremented by 1.\n\n3. **Checking Health**: After each move, the health is checked. If it becomes negative, Takahashi collapses, and the output is \"No\".\n\n4. **Consuming Items**: If the new position has an item and the health is below `K`, the item is consumed to set the health to `K`, and the item is removed from the set.\n\n5. **Completion**: If all moves are completed without the health dropping below zero, the output is \"Yes\".\n\nThis approach ensures that the simulation is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",

The Caps Lock key toggles its state (on/off) each time it is pressed, affecting the case of the 'a' key.\n\nTo solve this, we use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum time required to type the first `i` characters of the string, considering the current state of the Caps Lock key.

Press the 'a' key directly.\n2. Press the 'a' key and Shift simultaneously.\n3. Toggle the Caps Lock key and then press the appropriate key.\n\nWe update the DP table based on these options, ensuring that we always choose the minimum time required.

Starting with the initially infected person, the algorithm iteratively checks all uninfected people to see if they are within the distance \\( D \\) of any infected person. If so, they are marked as infected and added to the queue.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all possible infections, the program prints \"Yes\" or \"No\" for each person based on their infection status.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible infections are accounted for efficiently, leveraging the properties of BFS to explore all reachable nodes (people) within the given distance.",

This allows us to quickly check if adding a new edge would connect any forbidden pair.\n\n5. **Processing Queries**: For each query, we determine the roots of the two vertices involved in the new edge. If the pair of roots is in the set of forbidden pairs, the graph would no longer be good, so we print \"No\".

The goal is to maximize the sum of the tastiness of the courses he eats.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming States**: We use two states to represent Takahashi's stomach condition:\n   - `dp[0]`: Healthy stomach.\n   - `dp[1]`: Upset stomach.\n\n2. **Initialization**: Initially, Takahashi has a healthy stomach, so `dp[0] = 0` and `dp[1] = -infinity` (since he cannot start with an upset stomach).\n\n3. **Transition**:\n   - For each course, we consider both options: eating or skipping.\n   - If the course is antidotal (`X_i = 0`):\n     - Eating it keeps the stomach healthy or turns an upset stomach into a healthy one.\n   - If the course is poisonous (`X_i = 1`):\n     - Eating it turns a healthy stomach into an upset one.\n     - Eating it when already upset leads to death, so we avoid this by not updating the state.\n\n4. **Final Decision**: After processing all courses, the maximum possible sum of tastiness is the maximum value between the two states, ensuring that Takahashi is not dead.\n\n### Solution Code\nThe provided Python code implements this logic using dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum possible sum of tastiness while ensuring Takahashi survives the meal.\n\n### Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of courses.

The key is to manage his state (healthy or upset stomach) and maximize the total tastiness of the courses he eats.\n\nWe use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum tastiness achievable for each possible state after processing each course. The states are:\n\n- `dp[0]`: Takahashi has a healthy stomach.\n- `dp[1]`: Takahashi has an upset stomach.\n\nFor each course, we consider both options: eating or skipping it. If we eat the course, we update the state and the tastiness accordingly. If we skip it, the state remains the same, and the tastiness does not change.\n\nThe transitions are as follows:\n\n- For an antidotal course (X_i = 0):\n  - If the current state is healthy, eating it keeps the state healthy.\n  - If the current state is upset, eating it changes the state to healthy.\n- For a poisonous course (X_i = 1):\n  - If the current state is healthy, eating it changes the state to upset.\n  - If the current state is upset, eating it leads to death, so we skip it.\n\nAfter processing all courses, the maximum tastiness is the maximum value between the two states, ensuring that Takahashi is not dead. If both states are unreachable, the result is 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible sequences of decisions and find the optimal one that maximizes the total tastiness while keeping Takahashi alive."

We also initialize a min-heap to keep track of the top `K` elements and a variable `sum_top_k` to store the sum of these top `K` elements.\n\n2. **Processing Updates**: For each update, we first update the value in the sequence `A`. Then, we manage the min-heap:\n   - If the heap has fewer than `K` elements, we simply push the new value into the heap and update the sum.\n   - If the heap already has `K` elements, we compare the new value with the smallest element in the heap. If the new value is larger, we replace the smallest element with the new value and update the sum accordingly.\n\n3. **Handling Previous Values**: If the previous value of the updated position was non-zero, we need to adjust the heap and the sum:\n   - If the previous value was in the top `K`, we remove it from the sum and, if necessary, adjust the heap to maintain the top `K` elements.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing each update, we print the current value of `sum_top_k`, which is the sum of the top `K` elements in the sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently manage the top `K` elements and their sum with each update, leveraging the properties of a min-heap to maintain the necessary order and sum.",

Each sheet can be pasted anywhere by translating it, but it cannot be cut or rotated.\\n- Cut out an H_X\\\\times W_X area from sheet C along the grid. Here, a square of the cut-out sheet will be black if a black square of sheet A or B is pasted there, and transparent otherwise.\\n\\nDetermine whether Takahashi can achieve his goal by appropriately choosing the positions where the sheets are pasted and the area to cut out, that is, whether he can satisfy both of the following conditions.\\n\\n- The cut-out sheet includes all black squares of sheets A and B. The black squares of sheets A and B may overlap on the cut-out sheet.\\n- The cut-out sheet coincides sheet X without rotating or flipping.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nH_A W_A\\nA_1\\nA_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nA_{H_A}\\nH_B W_B\\nB_1\\nB_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nB_{H_B}\\nH_X W_X\\nX_1\\nX_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nX_{H_X}\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nIf Takahashi can achieve the goal described in the problem statement, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1\\\\leq H_A, W_A, H_B, W_B, H_X, W_X\\\\leq 10\\n- H_A, W_A, H_B, W_B, H_X, W_X are integers.\\n- A_i is a string of length W_A consisting of . and #.\\n- B_i is a string of length W_B consisting of . and #.\\n- X_i is a string of length W_X consisting of . and #.\\n- Sheets A, B, and X each contain at least one black square.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n3 5\\n#.#..\\n.....\\n.#...\\n2 2\\n#.\\n.#\\n5 3\\n...\\n#.#\\n.#.\\n.#.\\n...\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nYes\\n\\nFirst, paste sheet A onto sheet C, as shown in the figure below.\\n     \\\\vdots\\n  .......  \\n  .#.#...  \\n\\\\cdots.......\\\\cdots\\n  ..#....  \\n  .......  \\n     \\\\vdots\\n\\nNext, paste sheet B so that its top-left corner aligns with that of sheet A, as shown in the figure below.\\n     \\\\vdots\\n  .......  \\n  .#.#...  \\n\\\\cdots..#....\\\\cdots\\n  ..#....  \\n  .......  \\n     \\\\vdots\\n\\nNow, cut out a 5\\\\times 3 area with the square in the first row and second column of the range illustrated above as the top-left corner, as shown in the figure below.\\n...\\n#.#\\n.#.\\n.#.\\n...\\n\\nThis includes all black squares of sheets A and B and matches sheet X, satisfying the conditions.\\nTherefore, print Yes.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n2 2\\n#.\\n.#\\n2 2\\n#.\\n.#\\n2 2\\n##\\n##\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\nNo\\n\\nNote that sheets A and B may not be rotated or flipped when pasting them.\\n\\nSample Input 3\\n\\n1 1\\n#\\n1 2\\n##\\n1 1\\n#\\n\\nSample Output 3\\n\\nNo\\n\\nNo matter how you paste or cut, you cannot cut out a sheet that includes all black squares of sheet B, so you cannot satisfy the first condition.\\nTherefore, print No.\\n\\nSample Input 4\\n\\n3 3\\n###\\n...\\n...\\n3 3\\n#..\\n#..\\n#..\\n3 3\\n..#\\n..#\\n###\\n\\nSample Output 4\\n\\nYes\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

The key insight is to use a stack to keep track of the positions of the opening parentheses. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we check if there is a corresponding opening parenthesis on the stack. If so, we mark the substring between these two positions for removal.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty stack and a set to keep track of the indices of the substrings to be removed.\n\n2. **Traversing the String**: We traverse the string character by character.\n   - If we encounter an '(', we push its index onto the stack.\n   - If we encounter a ')', we check if the stack is not empty. If it is not empty, we pop the top index from the stack (which is the corresponding '(') and add the pair of indices (start, end) to the set of substrings to be removed.\n\n3. **Sorting and Removing Substrings**: After traversing the string, we sort the set of substrings to be removed in reverse order of their starting indices. This ensures that when we remove substrings, we do not affect the indices of other substrings that are yet to be removed.\n\n4. **Constructing the Result**: We iterate over the sorted list of substrings and remove them from the string S.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the processed string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently remove all valid substrings and obtain the final string as required. The use of a stack allows us to handle nested parentheses correctly, and sorting the substrings in reverse order ensures that we do not interfere with the indices of other substrings during the removal process.",

For each range in the set of indices to be removed, we mark the corresponding positions in the `remove` list as `True`.\n\n4. **Building the Result**: We iterate through the string and include characters in the result only if they are not marked for removal in the `remove` list.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the resulting string.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently remove all valid substrings starting with `(` and ending with `)` in a single pass through the string, making it suitable for the given constraints.",

To avoid precision issues with floating-point numbers, we use a comparison function that compares the cross-products of the success rates. This ensures that the sorting is accurate even for large values of A_i and B_i.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of tuples containing the number of heads, tails, and the person's index.\n2. **Comparison Function**: The comparison function calculates the cross-products of the success rates for two people and compares them. If the cross-products are equal, it breaks the tie by comparing the indices.\n3. **Sorting**: The list of tuples is sorted using the comparison function.\n4. **Output**: The sorted indices are extracted and printed in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sorting is both efficient and accurate, handling the constraints effectively.",

Specifically, we compare \\( A_i \\times (A_j + B_j) \\) with \\( A_j \\times (A_i + B_i) \\). This ensures accurate comparison without the need for floating-point division.\n\n4. **Sorting**: We sort the list of tuples using the custom comparator. If two people have the same success rate, we break the tie by their original indices in ascending order.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we extract the sorted indices and print them in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that the sorting is both efficient and accurate, even for large values of \\( N \\).",

The NAND operation is defined such that:\n- 0 NAND 0 = 1\n- 0 NAND 1 = 1\n- 1 NAND 0 = 1\n- 1 NAND 1 = 0\n\nTo solve this, we iterate over all possible starting points of the subarrays (i from 0 to N-1). For each starting point, we initialize the current NAND result with the value at that position. We then iterate over all possible ending points (j from i+1 to N-1), updating the current NAND result by performing the NAND operation with the next element in the subarray. We accumulate the sum of these results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible subarrays and compute the required sum efficiently. The nested loop structure ensures that we handle all pairs (i, j) where i <= j, and the NAND operation is applied sequentially as required.\n\nThe complexity of this solution is O(N^2), which is acceptable given the constraints (N up to 10^6).

For each possible sum `s`, we add the number of ways to achieve `s + x` where `x` is the outcome of the current die.\n\n3. **Total Outcomes**: The total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of faces on each die.\n\n4. **Favorable Outcomes**: The number of favorable outcomes is the value in `dp[10]`, which represents the number of ways to achieve a sum of 10.\n\n5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is calculated as the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes. Since we need to output the result modulo 998244353, we compute the modular inverse of the total number of outcomes and multiply it by the number of favorable outcomes.\n\n6. **Output**: The final result is printed as the computed probability modulo 998244353.",

The graph is represented by an array `A` where `A[i]` is the vertex that vertex `i+1` points to.\n\nThe approach involves traversing the graph starting from each unvisited vertex. We keep track of visited vertices to avoid reprocessing them. During the traversal, if we encounter a vertex that is already in the current path, we have found a cycle. We then extract the cycle from the path and return it.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a `visited` array to keep track of the vertices that have been processed.\n2. **Traversal**: For each vertex, if it hasn't been visited, we start a traversal from that vertex. We follow the outgoing edges and mark each vertex as visited.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: If during the traversal we encounter a vertex that is already in the current path, we have found a cycle. We then extract the cycle from the path.\n4. **Output**: Once a cycle is found, we print the length of the cycle and the vertices in the cycle.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find a cycle in the graph, leveraging the fact that each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge. The complexity is linear in the number of vertices, making it suitable for the given constraints.",

If the current cell is not holed, `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the three neighboring cells (top, left, and top-left) plus one.\n3. **Counting Holeless Squares**: Iterate through the DP table and sum up all the values to get the total number of holeless squares of all sizes.\n\n#### Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: O(H * W) for filling the DP table.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(H * W) for storing the DP table.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible holeless squares in the grid.",

This allows us to efficiently count the number of sellers and buyers that can participate at a given price X using binary search.\n\n2. **Binary Search on X**: We perform a binary search on the possible values of X. For each midpoint value of X in the search:\n   - We count the number of sellers who can sell an apple for X yen or less. This is done by finding the rightmost index in the sorted A where the value is less than or equal to X.\n   - We count the number of buyers who can buy an apple for X yen or more. This is done by finding the leftmost index in the sorted B where the value is greater than or equal to X and then calculating the number of buyers from that index to the end of the list.\n\n3. **Condition Check**: If the number of sellers is greater than or equal to the number of buyers for the current X, we try to find a smaller X that still satisfies the condition. Otherwise, we look for a larger X.\n\n4. **Output**: The smallest X that satisfies the condition is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum X using binary search, making the solution suitable for the given constraints.",

A valid parenthesis string must have balanced parentheses and must be properly nested.\n\nTo solve this, we use dynamic programming. We define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to form a valid parenthesis string up to the `i-th` character of `S` with `j` open brackets. The transitions are as follows:\n\n1. If the current character is `(`, we increment the count of open brackets.\n2. If the current character is `)`, we decrement the count of open brackets, ensuring it doesn't go below zero.\n3. If the current character is `?`, we consider both possibilities: treating it as `(` or `)`.\n\nThe final answer is `dp[n][0]`, where `n` is the length of `S`, and `0` indicates that all open brackets have been matched.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid configurations while keeping the computation within the constraints. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required limits.",

The maximum happiness across all combinations is determined and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",

This helps in determining the target values for each element in the sequence.\n2. **Target Values**: The target values are derived by distributing the total sum as evenly as possible.

If it is, we add their number of bets \\( C_i \\) and their index \\( i \\) to the `candidates` list.\n\n3. **Filtering Candidates**: If there are no candidates, we print `0`. Otherwise, we find the minimum number of bets \\( \\text{min\\_C} \\) among the candidates. We then filter the candidates to include only those with \\( C_i \\) equal to \\( \\text{min\\_C} \\).\n\n4. **Output**: We print the count of the filtered candidates and their indices in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly identify and print the people who have bet on the outcome \\( X \\) with the fewest bets.",

Just before the tournament starts, each player forms a one-person team, so there are N teams in total.\\nThe tournament has a total of N-1 matches. In each match, two different teams are chosen. One team goes first, and the other goes second. Each match will result in exactly one team winning. Specifically, for each i = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, N-1, the i-th match proceeds as follows.\\n\\n- The team with player p_i goes first, and the team with player q_i goes second.\\n- Let a and b be the numbers of players in the first and second teams, respectively. The first team wins with probability \\\\frac{a}{a+b}, and the second team wins with probability \\\\frac{b}{a+b}.\\n- Then, the two teams are combined into a single team.\\n\\nThe result of each match is independent of those of the others.\\nFor each of the N players, print the expected number of times the team with that player wins throughout the tournament, modulo 998244353.\\n How to print an expected value modulo 998244353\\nIt can be proved that the sought expected value is always rational. Also, the constraints of this problem guarantee that if the sought expected value is expressed as an irreducible fraction \\\\frac{y}{x}, then x is not divisible by 998244353. Now, there is a unique integer z between 0 and 998244352, inclusive, such that xz \\\\equiv y \\\\pmod{998244353}.

Team \\\\lbrace 4 \\\\rbrace wins with probability \\\\frac{1}{2}, and team \\\\lbrace 3 \\\\rbrace wins with probability \\\\frac{1}{2}. Then, the two teams are combined into a single team \\\\lbrace 3, 4 \\\\rbrace.\\n- The third match is played by team \\\\lbrace 5 \\\\rbrace, with player 5, and team \\\\lbrace 3, 4 \\\\rbrace, with player 3. Team \\\\lbrace 5 \\\\rbrace wins with probability \\\\frac{1}{3}, and team \\\\lbrace 3, 4 \\\\rbrace wins with probability \\\\frac{2}{3}.

The parent array keeps track of the root of each player's team, and the size array keeps track of the number of players in each team.\n\n2. **Processing Matches**: For each match, we find the roots of the two players involved. We then calculate the probabilities of each team winning based on their sizes. The expected wins for each team are updated accordingly.\n\n3. **Merging Teams**: After processing each match, we merge the two teams by updating the parent and size arrays. The expected wins of the merged team are also updated.\n\n4. **Output**: Finally, for each player, we find their root and print the expected number of wins for that team.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the expected number of wins for each player while keeping the complexity manageable within the given constraints.",

This is essentially the problem of finding a maximum weight matching in the graph.\n\nGiven the constraints (N \u2264 16), we can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently. The idea is to represent the matching using a bitmask, where each bit indicates whether a vertex is matched or not. We then iterate over all possible masks and update the maximum weight for each possible matching.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of vertices N and the edge weights. Construct a full adjacency matrix to store the weights of all edges.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[mask]` will store the maximum weight for the matching represented by `mask`. The mask is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a vertex is matched or not.\n\n3. **DP Transition**: Iterate over all possible masks. For each mask, iterate over all pairs of vertices that are not yet matched. Update the DP array by considering the new mask formed by matching these two vertices and adding the weight of the edge between them.\n\n4. **Result Extraction**: The maximum value in the DP array will be the maximum possible total weight of the chosen edges.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible matchings and find the one with the maximum weight efficiently, given the constraints.\n\n```python\n# YOUR CODE HERE\n\n\n```",

This is equivalent to finding a matching in the graph that maximizes the sum of the weights of the edges in the matching.\n\nGiven the constraints (N \u2264 16), a brute-force approach is feasible. We use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible ways to pair the vertices and calculate the total weight of each valid matching. The algorithm keeps track of the vertices that have already been used in the current matching and recursively tries all possible pairs of unused vertices, updating the maximum weight found so far.\n\nThe algorithm starts by reading the input and constructing the adjacency matrix of the graph. Then, it initializes a list to keep track of used vertices and calls the backtracking function with an initial weight of 0. The backtracking function iterates over all possible pairs of unused vertices, marks them as used, and recursively continues to find the maximum weight. After exploring all possibilities, the function prints the maximum weight found.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible matchings are considered, and the maximum weight is found efficiently given the problem constraints.",

Each word has a specific width, and words are separated by a space of width 1. The width of a line is the sum of the widths of the words in that line plus the spaces between them.\n\nTo solve this, we use a binary search approach to find the minimum width W that allows the sentence to fit into M lines. The binary search is performed between the maximum width of any single word (since each line must at least accommodate one word) and the total width if all words were placed in a single line (sum of all word widths plus the spaces between them).\n\nThe `can_fit` function checks if a given width W can accommodate the sentence in M or fewer lines. It iterates through the words, adding them to the current line until adding the next word would exceed the width W. If so, it starts a new line.

The sentence consists of \\( N \\) words, each with a specific width, and the words are separated by a space of width 1.\n\n#### Approach\n1. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to find the minimum width \\( W \\). The search range is from the maximum word width to the sum of all word widths plus the spaces between them.\n2. **Feasibility Check**: For each candidate width \\( W \\), we check if it is possible to fit the sentence into \\( M \\) or fewer lines. This is done by simulating the placement of words on lines, ensuring that the width of each line does not exceed \\( W \\).\n3. **Simulation**: We iterate through the words, adding them to the current line if they fit, otherwise starting a new line. We count the number of lines used and check if it is within the limit \\( M \\).\n\n#### Solution Code\nThe provided Python code implements this approach. It reads the input values, performs the binary search to find the minimum width, and prints the result. The `can_fit` function checks if a given width \\( W \\) can accommodate the sentence in \\( M \\) or fewer lines.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures that the minimum width is found using a combination of binary search and a linear feasibility check.",

Each word has a specific width, and words are separated by a space of width 1.\n\n#### Approach\n1. **Binary Search**: We use binary search to determine the minimum width \\( W \\). The search range is between the maximum word width (since each word must fit in a line) and the total width if all words are placed in a single line (sum of all word widths plus \\( N-1 \\) spaces).\n\n2. **Feasibility Check**: For each candidate width \\( W \\) during the binary search, we check if it is possible to fit the sentence into \\( M \\) or fewer lines. This is done by simulating the placement of words:\n   - Start with the first word in the first line.\n   - For each subsequent word, try to place it in the current line if it fits (i.e., the current line width plus the word width plus 1 for the space does not exceed \\( W \\)). If it doesn't fit, start a new line.\n   - Count the number of lines used. If it is within the limit \\( M \\), the width \\( W \\) is feasible.\n\n3. **Binary Search Adjustment**: If the current width \\( W \\) is feasible, we try a smaller width. Otherwise, we try a larger width.\n\n#### Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: The binary search runs in \\( O(\\log(\\text{sum of all widths})) \\), and for each candidate width, the feasibility check runs in \\( O(N) \\). Thus, the overall complexity is \\( O(N \\log(\\text{sum of all widths})) \\).\n- **Space Complexity**: The algorithm uses \\( O(1) \\) additional space.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum window width while keeping the solution within the problem constraints."

This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`).\n   - The sum of all `b` values that are less than `P - a` is computed using a precomputed prefix sum array for B.\n   - The total price for these combinations is `a * count + sum_b_less`, where `count` is the number of `b` values less than `P - a`.\n   - For the remaining `b` values (those where `a + b >= P`), the price is simply `P` multiplied by the number of such `b` values.\n   - The total price for all combinations is accumulated and printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the constraints effectively.",

Each plan is stored as a tuple containing its cost and the list of parameter increments.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: A dictionary `dp` is initialized where the keys are tuples representing the current sum of parameters, and the values are the minimum cost to achieve that sum. The initial state is `(0,) * K` with a cost of 0.\n\n3. **DP Transition**: For each plan, the DP table is updated. For each existing state in `dp`, two possibilities are considered: not taking the plan and taking the plan. When taking the plan, the new state is computed by adding the plan's increments to the current state, ensuring that no parameter exceeds \\( P \\).\n\n4. **Goal Check**: After processing all plans, the DP table is checked for any state where all parameters are at least \\( P \\). The minimum cost among these states is determined.\n\n5. **Output**: If a valid state is found, the minimum cost is printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed indicating that the goal cannot be achieved.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible combinations of plans are considered efficiently using dynamic programming, leveraging the small constraints on \\( K \\) and \\( P \\).",

For each combination, we calculate the total cost and the total increase in each parameter.\n3. **Check Goal**: For each combination, we check if the total increase in each parameter is at least P. If it is, we update the minimum cost if this combination's cost is lower than the current minimum.\n4. **Output**: After checking all combinations, if a valid combination is found, we print the minimum cost. Otherwise, we print -1.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to achieve the goal and find the one with the minimum cost. Given the constraints, this method is feasible and efficient."

The key insight is to process the slimes in increasing order of size and handle the counts appropriately.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: We read the number of slime types and their respective sizes and counts.\n2. **Processing**: We use a dictionary to keep track of the counts of each slime size. We process the slimes in increasing order of size.\n3. **Synthesis**: For each slime size, if there are at least two slimes, we synthesize them into one slime of double the size. We update the counts accordingly.\n4. **Result Calculation**: We keep track of the remaining slimes that cannot be synthesized further and add them to the result.\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the minimum number of slimes achievable.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle the slimes efficiently and minimize the number of slimes by performing the synthesis operations optimally.",

Update the count of the new size (double the original size) in the dictionary.\n4. **Counting Remaining Slimes**: After processing all sizes, count the remaining slimes that could not be synthesized further.\n5. **Output the Result**: Print the total count of remaining slimes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    N = int(data[0])\n    S = []\n    C = []\n    index = 1\n    for _ in range(N):\n        S.append(int(data[index]))\n        C.append(int(data[index+1]))\n        index += 2\n    \n    slime_dict = {}\n    for s, c in zip(S, C):\n        slime_dict[s] = c\n    \n    result = 0\n    for s in sorted(slime_dict.keys()):\n        c = slime_dict[s]\n        while c > 1:\n            if s * 2 in slime_dict:\n                slime_dict[s * 2] += c // 2\n            else:\n                slime_dict[s * 2] = c // 2\n            c = c % 2\n        if c == 1:\n            result += 1\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers. The first integer is the number of slime sizes, followed by pairs of size and count.\n2. **Dictionary Setup**: A dictionary is used to map each slime size to its count.\n3. **Processing Slimes**: For each slime size, the synthesis operation is performed as long as there are at least two slimes of that size. The count of the new size (double the original) is updated in the dictionary.\n4. **Counting Remaining Slimes**: After processing, the remaining slimes that could not be synthesized further are counted.\n5. **Output**: The total count of remaining slimes is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that the synthesis operations are performed optimally, minimizing the number of slimes efficiently."

This reads all the input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings based on spaces. The first element is `n`, the number of integers, and the rest are the integers themselves.\n2. **Extracting Integers**: The first element is `n`, and the rest are the integers `a`.\n3. **Checking Equality**: We check if all elements in `a` are equal to the first element `a[0]` using the `all()` function combined with a generator expression.\n4. **Output**: If all elements are equal, print \"Yes\". Otherwise, print \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly determine if all given integers are the same, and it handles the constraints efficiently.",

This is done by transforming the problem into finding a path with the maximum value of (beauty - ratio * cost) using a modified Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n3. **Checking Feasibility**: If such a path exists, it means the ratio is achievable, and we can try a higher ratio. Otherwise, we try a lower ratio.\n\n4. **Precision**: The binary search is repeated until the difference between the low and high values is sufficiently small, ensuring the result is accurate to within the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum possible ratio by leveraging the properties of binary search and the ability to transform the problem into a form suitable for Dijkstra's algorithm.",

This is essentially a problem of finding the number of connected components in a grid where each cell can be part of a component if it contains a sensor and is adjacent to other sensors.\n\nTo solve this, we use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach:\n1. We initialize a visited matrix to keep track of the cells that have already been processed.\n2. We iterate over each cell in the grid. If the cell contains a sensor and has not been visited, we start a BFS from that cell.\n3. During BFS, we mark all reachable sensor cells as visited and add them to the queue to explore their neighbors.\n4. Each BFS call corresponds to one connected component (one sensor group), so we increment the sensor count each time we start a new BFS.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly count all distinct sensor groups on the grid. The complexity is O(H * W) since each cell is processed at most once."

This can be modeled as a graph problem where each city is a node, and the edges represent the travel options between cities.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize two distance arrays, `dist_car` and `dist_train`, to keep track of the minimum time to reach each city using only the car and using the car and then the train, respectively.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: We use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore the cities in order of increasing travel time. Each entry in the queue contains the current time, the current city, and the current mode of transportation (car or train).\n\n3. **Exploration**:\n   - If the current mode is car, we explore both continuing with the car and switching to the train.\n   - If the current mode is train, we only explore continuing with the train.\n   - For each exploration, we update the corresponding distance array and push the new state into the priority queue.\n\n4. **Termination**: When we reach city N, we print the current time, which is the minimum travel time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum travel time by always exploring the most promising paths first.\n\n### Complexity\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm uses Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue, which has a time complexity of \\(O((V + E) \\log V)\\), where \\(V\\) is the number of cities and \\(E\\) is the number of edges. Given that \\(E = V^2\\) in the worst case, the complexity is \\(O(V^2 \\log V)\\).\n- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(V^2)\\) due to the adjacency matrix representation of the graph and the priority queue.\n\nThis solution is efficient given the constraints and ensures that we find the optimal path in a reasonable amount of time.",

The key constraint is that once you switch from the company car to the train, you cannot switch back.\n\nTo solve this, we use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm that keeps track of the current mode of transportation (car or train) for each city. We maintain two distance arrays:\n- `dist_car[i]`: the minimum time to reach city `i` using only the company car.\n- `dist_train[i]`: the minimum time to reach city `i` using the company car and then switching to the train.\n\nWe initialize the distances for city 1 (the starting point) to 0. We then use a priority queue to explore the cities, updating the distances based on the current mode of transportation. When we are in car mode, we can either continue using the car or switch to the train.

The approach uses Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest paths, considering the two modes of transportation.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize two distance arrays, `dist_car` and `dist_train`, to keep track of the minimum time to reach each city using only the car and using the car followed by the train, respectively.\n\n2. **Priority Queue**: We use a priority queue (heap) to process cities in order of increasing travel time. Each entry in the heap contains the current time, the city, and the mode of transportation.\n\n3. **Processing**: For each city, we consider all possible next cities. Depending on the current mode of transportation, we calculate the new travel time and update the distance arrays accordingly. If we are using the car, we have the option to continue using the car or switch to the train. If we are using the train, we can only continue using the train.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all cities, the minimum time to reach city N is the minimum value between `dist_car[N-1]` and `dist_train[N-1]`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the shortest path while considering the constraints on switching transportation modes."

The expected value is computed using dynamic programming, where `dp[x]` represents the expected value starting from x.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a `dp` array of size N+1 to store the expected values.\n2. **Base Case**: For `x = N`, the expected value is simply `A[N-1]` (since A is 0-based).\n3. **Recursive Case**: For each `x` from N-1 down to 1, the expected value is computed as `A[x-1] + dp[x+1]`, modulo 998244353.\n4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The total expected value is the sum of `dp[1..N]` divided by N, modulo 998244353. This is because the initial value of x is 0, and we need to consider all possible starting points.\n5. **Output**: The final expected value is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the expected value using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, adhering to the constraints provided.",

For each x, we sum the expected values of all y > x and add the payment A[y].

To achieve this efficiently, we can use a stack-based approach.\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by reading the input string S.\n2. **Stack Usage**: Iterate through each character in S and push it onto a stack.\n3. **Checking for \"ABC\"**: After pushing a character onto the stack, check if the last three characters in the stack form the substring \"ABC\". This is done by checking if the third last character is 'A', the second last is 'B', and the last is 'C'.\n4. **Removing \"ABC\"**: If the above condition is met, pop the last three characters from the stack, effectively removing the \"ABC\" substring.\n5. **Final Output**: After processing all characters, the stack will contain the final string with all \"ABC\" substrings removed. Join the characters in the stack and print the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently remove all occurrences of \"ABC\" in a single pass through the string, making it suitable for the given constraints."

The list is of size N+1 to accommodate candidate numbers from 1 to N.\n3. **Current Winner Tracking**: We maintain two variables, `current_winner` and `max_votes`, to keep track of the candidate with the most votes and the number of votes they have.\n4. **Processing Votes**: For each vote, we update the vote count for the corresponding candidate. If this candidate now has more votes than the current maximum, we update the `current_winner` and `max_votes`. If the candidate has the same number of votes as the current maximum, we choose the candidate with the smaller number.\n5. **Output**: After processing each vote, we print the current winner.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the winner after each vote is counted, with a time complexity of O(M) and a space complexity of O(N).",

The height of the tree is then the maximum depth among all nodes.\n\nOnce we have the depth of each node, the height of the tree is simply the maximum depth found. This height is the minimum number of operations required to delete vertex 1.\n\nThe code reads the input, constructs the tree using adjacency lists, performs BFS to compute the depth of each node, and then determines the height of the tree by finding the maximum depth. Finally, it prints the height, which is the answer to the problem.",

The center of the grid is marked with 'T' for Takahashi. The spiral filling ensures that each dragon part is placed in a cell adjacent to the previous part by an edge. The algorithm uses a layer-by-layer approach to fill the grid, adjusting the direction of movement after each layer to maintain the spiral pattern. This ensures that all conditions are met, including the adjacency requirement for the dragon parts.\n\nThe code initializes a grid of size N x N and sets the center cell to 'T'. It then iterates over the layers of the grid, filling each layer in a spiral order. The direction of movement is adjusted after each layer to continue the spiral. Finally, the grid is printed row by row, ensuring the correct format for the output."

The sequence of good integers starts as 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 40, etc.\n\nTo solve this, we can observe that the good integers can be mapped to numbers in base 5, where each digit in base 5 corresponds to an even digit in base 10.

In base 5, 7 is 12. Mapping 1 to 2 and 2 to 4 gives 24, which is the 8th good integer.\n- For N = 133, (N-1) = 132. In base 5, 132 is 1012. Mapping 1 to 2, 0 to 0, 1 to 2, and 2 to 4 gives 2024, which is the 133rd good integer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we can efficiently compute the N-th good integer even for large values of N (up to 10^12).",

Specifically, the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in base-5 correspond to 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 in the good integer sequence.\n\nHere's the step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Mapping**: Treat N as a number in base-5. Each digit in this base-5 representation corresponds to an even digit in the good integer.\n2. **Conversion**: Convert N from base-10 to base-5, and then map each base-5 digit to its corresponding even digit.\n3. **Construction**: Construct the good integer by reading the mapped digits in reverse order (since the least significant digit in base-5 corresponds to the least significant digit in the good integer).\n\nFor example:\n- For N = 8, the base-5 representation is 13. Mapping 1 to 2 and 3 to 6 gives the digits 2 and 6. Reading them in reverse order gives 24, which is the 8th smallest good integer.\n- For N = 133, the base-5 representation is 1013. Mapping 1 to 2, 0 to 0, 1 to 2, and 3 to 6 gives the digits 2, 0, 2, 6. Reading them in reverse order gives 2024, which is the 133rd smallest good integer.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the N-th smallest good integer by leveraging the properties of base-5 representation and the mapping to even digits.",

The approach involves using binary representation to determine which bottles to give to each friend.\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Friends (M):** \n   - Calculate the smallest M such that \\(2^M \\geq N\\). This ensures that each bottle can be uniquely identified by a combination of friends.\n\n2. **Distribute the Bottles:**\n   - For each friend (i from 0 to M-1), assign bottles where the i-th bit in their binary representation is set to 1. This way, each bottle is assigned to a unique subset of friends.\n\n3. **Receive Feedback:**\n   - The judge provides a string S of length M, where each character indicates whether the corresponding friend had a stomach upset (1) or not (0).\n\n4. **Identify the Spoiled Bottle:**\n   - Convert the feedback string S into a binary number. Each '1' in S corresponds to a set bit in the binary representation of the spoiled bottle's number. If the result is 0, it means the spoiled bottle is the last one (N).\n\nThis method ensures that the spoiled bottle is uniquely identified with the minimum number of friends, leveraging the properties of binary numbers to encode the information efficiently.",

The key insight is to use binary representation to encode the information about which bottle is spoiled.\n\n1. **Determine the Number of Friends (M):**\n   - The minimum number of friends required is the smallest integer M such that \\(2^M \\geq N\\). This is because each friend can represent a bit in the binary representation of the bottle number.\n   - We calculate M as the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of N.\n\n2. **Distribute Bottles to Friends:**\n   - For each friend (bit position), we assign bottles whose binary representation has a '1' in that bit position.\n   - This way, each bottle is assigned to a unique combination of friends based on its binary representation.\n\n3. **Receive Feedback from Friends:**\n   - The judge provides a string S of length M, where each character indicates whether the corresponding friend had a stomach upset (1) or not (0).\n   - This string represents the binary digits of the spoiled bottle's number.\n\n4. **Determine the Spoiled Bottle:**\n   - Convert the binary string S to a decimal number X, which corresponds to the spoiled bottle's number.\n   - Ensure X is within the valid range [1, N]. If not, adjust it to 1 (though this should not happen given the constraints).\n\nThis approach ensures that the spoiled bottle is identified with the minimum number of friends, leveraging the binary representation to encode and decode the information efficiently.",

Specifically, if the bridge is on\n    # the shorter path between two consecutive Xs, removing it will force the tour to take\n    # the longer path.\n    \n    # Therefore, for each bridge, we can compute the additional distance that would be\n    # incurred if that bridge were removed, and then choose the bridge that minimizes the\n    # total additional distance.\n    \n    # To implement this, we need to find, for each bridge, the pairs of consecutive Xs\n    # that would be affected by its removal.\n    \n    # Since the bridges are in a cycle, we can represent the bridges as the edges between\n    # consecutive islands, including the edge between N and 1.\n    \n    # We can represent the bridges as pairs (i, i+1) for i from 1 to N-1, and (N, 1).\n    \n    # For each bridge (u, v), we need to find all pairs (X[i], X[i+1]) such that the\n    # shortest path between X[i] and X[i+1] includes the bridge (u, v).\n    \n    # The shortest path between two islands a and b is either the clockwise path or the\n    # counter-clockwise path. The bridge (u, v) is on the shortest path if it is on the\n    # path that is being taken.\n    \n    # To find the pairs (X[i], X[i+1]) that would be affected by removing bridge (u, v),\n    # we need to find all pairs where the shortest path between X[i] and X[i+1] includes\n    # the bridge (u, v).\n    \n    # This can be done by checking, for each pair (X[i], X[i+1]), whether the bridge (u, v)\n    # is on the path that is being taken.\n    \n    # However, doing this for each bridge and each pair would be O(N*M), which is too slow.\n    \n    # Instead, we can precompute, for each pair (X[i], X[i+1]), the bridges that are on\n    # the shortest path between them.\n    \n    # Then, for each bridge, we can sum the additional distances that would be incurred\n    # if that bridge were removed.\n    \n    # To find the bridges on the shortest path between two islands a and b, we can consider\n    # the two possible paths:\n    # 1.

The vertices are converted to 0-based indexing for easier handling in the algorithm.\n\n2. **Distance Matrix Initialization**: A distance matrix `dist` is initialized with infinity (`INF`) to represent the absence of a direct edge. The diagonal is set to 0 since the distance from a vertex to itself is zero.\n\n3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: This algorithm is used to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. It iteratively updates the distance matrix by considering all possible intermediate vertices.\n\n4. **Dynamic Programming for TSP**: A dynamic programming approach is used to solve the problem of finding the minimum walk that visits all vertices. The state `dp[mask][u]` represents the minimum cost to visit all vertices in the bitmask `mask`, ending at vertex `u`. The algorithm iterates over all possible masks and updates the DP table based on the shortest paths computed earlier.\n\n5. **Finding the Minimum Cost**: After filling the DP table, the minimum cost is found by checking the values in the DP table for the full mask (all vertices visited).\n\n6. **Output**: If a valid walk is found, the minimum cost is printed.

The goal is to find the shortest path from stage 1 to stage N.\n\nWe use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in this graph. The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, ordered by the current shortest known distance to each node. We start by initializing the distance to stage 1 as 0 and all other distances as infinity. We then iteratively process each node, updating the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\nIn the implementation:\n1. We read the number of stages and the details of each stage.\n2. We initialize a distance array with infinity and set the distance to stage 1 as 0.\n3. We use a priority queue to perform Dijkstra's algorithm, processing each node and updating the distances to its neighbors based on the two possible actions.\n4. The algorithm terminates when we reach stage N, and we print the shortest distance to stage N.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum time required to reach stage N, considering all possible paths and actions.",

We then initialize a 2D list `possible` to keep track of which cells could be Takahashi's current position. Initially, all land cells (represented by '.') are marked as possible.\n\n2. **Reverse Moves**: To determine the possible starting positions, we reverse the move sequence T. This allows us to work backwards from the final position to the starting position.\n\n3. **Backtracking**: For each move in the reversed sequence, we update the `possible` list. For each cell that is currently marked as possible, we check if the corresponding move (in reverse) leads to a land cell. If it does, we mark that cell as possible in the new `possible` list.\n\n4. **Counting Possible Positions**: After processing all moves in reverse order, we count the number of cells that are still marked as possible in the `possible` list. This count represents the number of cells that could be Takahashi's current position.\n\n5. **Output**: Finally, we print the count of possible positions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently narrow down the possible positions by considering the constraints imposed by the move sequence and the grid layout.",

This ensures that we efficiently narrow down the range to find the K-th smallest number.\n\n3. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (GCD) is used to compute the LCM of N and M, which is necessary for counting the numbers divisible by both N and M.\n\nBy using this approach, we can handle the large constraints efficiently and find the required K-th smallest number.",

To solve this, we need to efficiently count the number of integers up to a certain value that are divisible by exactly one of N or M.\n\n1. **Counting Divisible Numbers**: For a given integer x, the number of integers less than or equal to x that are divisible by N is `x // N`. Similarly, the number divisible by M is `x // M`. The number divisible by both N and M is `x // LCM(N, M)`, where LCM is the least common multiple of N and M. The count of numbers divisible by exactly one of N or M is then `(x // N) + (x // M) - 2 * (x // LCM(N, M))`.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: To find the K-th smallest number, we use binary search. We search for the smallest x such that the count of numbers divisible by exactly one of N or M up to x is at least K. This is done by repeatedly narrowing down the search range based on whether the count at the midpoint is less than or greater than K.\n\n3. **Implementation**: The function `count_divisible_by_only_one` calculates the count of numbers divisible by exactly one of N or M up to a given x. The function `find_kth_smallest` performs the binary search to find the K-th smallest number. The main part of the code reads the input values, calls the function, and prints the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the desired number even for large values of N, M, and K, leveraging the properties of divisibility and binary search.",

Print Yes if S' is a good string and No otherwise.\\n\\nInput\\n\\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\\nN Q\\nS\\nquery_1\\nquery_2\\n\\\\vdots\\nquery_Q\\n\\nEach query query_i (1\\\\leq i\\\\leq Q) is given in the form:\\n1 L R \\n\\nor:\\n2 L R\\n\\nOutput\\n\\nLet K be the number of queries of type 2. Print K lines.\\nThe i-th line should contain the response to the i-th query of type 2.\\n\\nConstraints\\n\\n\\n- 1\\\\leq N, Q\\\\leq 5\\\\times 10^5\\n- S is a string of length N consisting of 0 and 1.\\n- 1\\\\leq L\\\\leq R\\\\leq N for queries of types 1 and 2.\\n- There is at least one query of type 2.\\n- N, Q, L, and R are integers.\\n\\nSample Input 1\\n\\n5 6\\n10100\\n2 1 3\\n2 1 5\\n1 1 4\\n2 1 5\\n1 3 3\\n2 2 4\\n\\nSample Output 1\\n\\nYes\\nNo\\nYes\\nNo\\n\\nInitially, S=10100. When processing the queries in the order they are given, the following occurs:\\n\\n- For the first query, the string obtained by extracting the 1-st to 3-rd characters of S is S'=101. This is a good string, so print Yes.\\n- For the second query, the string obtained by extracting the 1-st to 5-th characters of S is S'=10100. This is not a good string, so print No.\\n- For the third query, flip each of the 1-st to 4-th characters of S. The string S becomes S=01010.\\n- For the fourth query, the string obtained by extracting the 1-st to 5-th character of S is S'=01010. This is a good string, so print Yes.\\n- For the fifth query, flip the 3-rd character of S. The string S becomes S=01110.\\n- For the sixth query, the string obtained by extracting the 2-nd to 4-th character of S is S'=111. This is not a good string, so print No.\\n\\nSample Input 2\\n\\n1 2\\n1\\n1 1 1\\n2 1 1\\n\\nSample Output 2\\n\\nYes\\n\\nNote that a string of a single character 0 or 1 satisfies the condition of being a good string.\\n\\n### Format: Read the inputs from stdin solve the problem and write the answer to stdout (do not directly test on the sample inputs).

Then, for each adjacent vertex \\( v \\) with \\( W[v] < W[u] \\), we add \\( A[u] \\) pieces to \\( v \\).\n\n4. **Output**: The total number of operations is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the number of operations by always processing vertices with smaller weights first, allowing us to propagate the pieces efficiently through the graph.",

A square number is an integer that is the square of another integer.\n\n#### Key Insight:\nFor two numbers \\(A_i\\) and \\(A_j\\), their product \\(A_i \\times A_j\\) is a square number if and only if the product of their square-free parts is 1. The square-free part of a number is obtained by removing all squared factors from its prime factorization.\n\n#### Steps:\n1. **Square-Free Part Calculation**: For each number in the sequence, compute its square-free part.\n2. **Counting**: Use a dictionary to count how many times each square-free part appears.\n3. **Pair Counting**:\n   - If the square-free part is 0, it means the number is 0. Any pair involving 0 will result in a square number (since 0 multiplied by any number is 0, which is a square). So, count all pairs involving 0.\n   - For other square-free parts, count the number of pairs where the square-free parts are the same. This is because the product of two numbers with the same square-free part will be a square number.\n\n#### Implementation:\n- We use a function `square_free_part` to compute the square-free part of a number by removing all squared factors.\n- We then use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each square-free part.\n- Finally, we calculate the total number of valid pairs based on the counts of square-free parts.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the pairs without having to check each pair individually, making it suitable for the given constraints.",

For example, for `n = 12`, the square-free part is `3` because `12 = 2^2 * 3`.\n3. **Counting Pairs**: The `main` function reads the input, processes each number to find its square-free part, and uses a dictionary to count how many times each square-free part has been seen. For each number, it adds the count of previously seen numbers with the same square-free part to the total count of valid pairs.\n4. **Output**: Finally, the total count of valid pairs is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `A_i * A_j` is a square number, leveraging the properties of square-free parts and prime factorization.",

Therefore, we count all pairs involving zero separately.\n\n4. **Total Pairs**: The total number of valid pairs is the sum of pairs from all square-free parts, including the special handling for zero.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all pairs that satisfy the given conditions.",

We then read the sequence of updates, where each update consists of a player \\( A_i \\) and a score increment \\( B_i \\).\n\n2. **Tracking Scores**: We use a dictionary `scores` to keep track of the current score of each player. Initially, all players have a score of 0.\n\n3. **Counting Unique Scores**: We use another dictionary `count` to keep track of how many players have each unique score. Initially, all players have a score of 0, so `count[0]` is set to \\( N \\), and the number of unique scores `unique` is set to 1.\n\n4. **Processing Updates**: For each update:\n   - We retrieve the previous score of the player.\n   - We decrement the count of the previous score in the `count` dictionary. If the count reaches zero, we remove the score from the dictionary and decrement the `unique` count.\n   - We update the player's score by adding the increment.\n   - We increment the count of the new score in the `count` dictionary. If the new score was not previously in the dictionary, we increment the `unique` count.\n   - We print the current number of unique scores.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently track the number of unique scores after each update, using dictionaries to manage the counts and the unique score values. The overall complexity is \\( O(T) \\), which is suitable given the constraints."
