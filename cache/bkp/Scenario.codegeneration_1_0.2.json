The number of test cases `t` is read first. For each test case, the number of digits `n` is read, followed by the `n` digits themselves.\n\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, we consider adding 1 to each digit one by one and calculate the product of the modified array. We keep track of the maximum product obtained.\n\n3. **Calculating the Product**: For each modification, we compute the product of all digits in the array. This is done by iterating through the array and multiplying the digits together.\n\n4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, we print the maximum product for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to add 1 to one of the digits and find the one that maximizes the product. The solution is efficient given the constraints, especially since `n` is small (up to 9)."

This can be efficiently solved using a dynamic programming approach.\n\n1. **Initialization**: For each test case, initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity and `current_sum` to the first element of the array.\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element, check if its parity is different from the previous element. If so, add it to `current_sum`. Otherwise, reset `current_sum` to the current element.\n3. **Update `max_sum`**: After each step, update `max_sum` to be the maximum of itself and `current_sum`.\n4. **Output the results**: After processing all test cases, print the results.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum of a subarray with alternating parities in linear time with respect to the size of the array."

But Yarik loves not only listening to music but also writing it. He likes electronic music most of all, so he has created his own system of music notes, which, in his opinion, is best for it.\\n\\nSince Yarik also likes informatics, in his system notes are denoted by integers of $2^k$, where $k \\\\ge 1$\\u00a0\\u2014 a positive integer. But, as you know, you can't use just notes to write music, so Yarik uses combinations of two notes. The combination of two notes $(a, b)$, where $a = 2^k$ and $b = 2^l$, he denotes by the integer $a^b$.\\n\\nFor example, if $a = 8 = 2^3$, $b = 4 = 2^2$, then the combination $(a, b)$ is denoted by the integer $a^b = 8^4 = 4096$. Note that different combinations can have the same notation, e.g., the combination $(64, 2)$ is also denoted by the integer $4096 = 64^2$.\\n\\nYarik has already chosen $n$ notes that he wants to use in his new melody. However, since their integers can be very large, he has written them down as an array $a$ of length $n$, then the note $i$ is $b_i = 2^{a_i}$. The integers in array $a$ can be repeated.\\n\\nThe melody will consist of several combinations of two notes. Yarik was wondering how many pairs of notes $b_i, b_j$ $(i < j)$ exist such that the combination $(b_i, b_j)$ is equal to the combination $(b_j, b_i)$. In other words, he wants to count the number of pairs $(i, j)$ $(i < j)$ such that $b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}$.

Given that \\(b_i = 2^{a_i}\\) and \\(b_j = 2^{a_j}\\), the condition \\(b_i^{b_j} = b_j^{b_i}\\) translates to \\((2^{a_i})^{(2^{a_j})} = (2^{a_j})^{(2^{a_i})}\\). Simplifying this, we get \\(2^{a_i \\cdot 2^{a_j}} = 2^{a_j \\cdot 2^{a_i}}\\), which implies \\(a_i \\cdot 2^{a_j} = a_j \\cdot 2^{a_i}\\).\n\nThis equality holds in two cases:\n1. When \\(a_i = a_j\\).\n2. When \\(a_i = 1\\) and \\(a_j = 2\\) (or vice versa).\n\nThus, the solution involves:\n1. Counting the number of pairs where \\(a_i = a_j\\).\n2. Counting the number of pairs where one element is 1 and the other is 2.\n\nThe function `count_valid_pairs` first counts the frequency of each element in the array. It then calculates the number of pairs where elements are the same using the combination formula \\(C(n, 2) = n \\cdot (n - 1) / 2\\). Additionally, it counts the pairs where one element is 1 and the other is 2 by multiplying their frequencies. The total count is the sum of these two values.\n\nThe `main` function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the result."

This value is added to the score.\n4. **Returning the Score**: After processing all columns, we return the accumulated score.\n\nThis approach ensures that we correctly simulate the described operations and efficiently compute the final score."

The window is defined by two pointers, `left` and `right`, which represent the start and end of the current window.\n\n3. **Deletion Calculation**: For each window, we calculate the number of deletions required to make all elements in the window equal. This is done by subtracting the number of elements in the window from the total number of positions covered by the window.\n\n4. **Adjusting the Window**: If the number of deletions exceeds `k`, we move the `left` pointer to reduce the window size and thus the number of deletions.\n\n5. **Max Length Update**: We keep track of the maximum length of any window that can be made equal with at most `k` deletions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest possible equal subarray by leveraging the properties of the indices and the sliding window technique."

If so, we recursively compute the number of valid permutations and add it to the total.\n\n3. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we take the result modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\) at each step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid special permutations using dynamic programming and memoization."

This is done using `set(nums)` and taking its length.\n2. **Sliding Window Approach**: We use a sliding window technique to count the number of subarrays that contain all distinct elements. We maintain a frequency dictionary to keep track of the elements in the current window.\n3. **Expand the Window**: As we expand the window by moving the right pointer, we update the frequency of the current element and the count of distinct elements in the window.\n4. **Shrink the Window**: When the window contains all distinct elements, we count all possible subarrays ending at the current right pointer and starting from the left pointer to the current left position. We then move the left pointer to shrink the window and continue the process.\n5. **Count Subarrays**: The total count of such subarrays is accumulated and returned as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all complete subarrays in linear time relative to the size of the input array."

We can achieve this efficiently using a sliding window approach combined with two deques to keep track of the minimum and maximum elements in the current window.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize two deques, `min_deque` and `max_deque`, to keep track of the indices of the minimum and maximum elements in the current window. We also initialize `left` to 0, which represents the start of the window, and `result` to 0, which will store the count of valid subarrays.\n\n2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element in the array (indexed by `right`):\n   - **Maintain the min deque**: We remove elements from the end of `min_deque` that are greater than the current element, ensuring that `min_deque` always contains the indices of the smallest elements in the current window.\n   - **Maintain the max deque**: Similarly, we remove elements from the end of `max_deque` that are smaller than the current element, ensuring that `max_deque` always contains the indices of the largest elements in the current window.\n   - **Adjust the window**: If the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the current window exceeds 2, we move the `left` pointer to the right, effectively shrinking the window from the left. We also remove indices from the deques that are no longer within the window.\n   - **Count valid subarrays**: For each valid window, the number of valid subarrays ending at `right` is `right - left + 1`. We add this to `result`.\n\n3. **Return the result**: After processing all elements, `result` contains the total number of continuous subarrays where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements is at most 2.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count all valid subarrays in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs."

For example, \\\"aa\\\", \\\"aba\\\", \\\"adbgad\\\", and, \\\"abab\\\" are semi-palindrome and \\\"a\\\", \\\"ab\\\", and, \\\"abca\\\" are not.\\nA substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.\\n\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"abcac\\\", k = 2\\nOutput: 1\\nExplanation: We can divide s into substrings \\\"ab\\\" and \\\"cac\\\". The string \\\"cac\\\" is already a semi-palindrome. If we change \\\"ab\\\" to \\\"aa\\\", it becomes a semi-palindrome with d = 1.\\nIt can be shown that there is no way to divide the string \\\"abcac\\\" into two semi-palindrome substrings. Therefore, the answer would be at least 1.\\nExample 2:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"abcdef\\\", k = 2\\nOutput: 2\\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \\\"abc\\\" and \\\"def\\\". Each of the substrings \\\"abc\\\" and \\\"def\\\" requires one change to become a semi-palindrome, so we need 2 changes in total to make all substrings semi-palindrome.\\nIt can be shown that we cannot divide the given string into two substrings in a way that it would require less than 2 changes.\\nExample 3:\\n\\nInput: s = \\\"aabbaa\\\", k = 3\\nOutput: 0\\nExplanation: We can divide it into substrings \\\"aa\\\", \\\"bb\\\" and \\\"aa\\\".\\nThe strings \\\"aa\\\" and \\\"bb\\\" are already semi-palindromes.

Each split must ensure that the resulting subarrays either have a length of one or their sum is at least `m`.\n\nThe key insight is that if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in the array whose sum is at least `m`, then it is possible to perform the splits. This is because we can always split the array at that pair, and then continue splitting the resulting subarrays until each subarray is of length one.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. If the array length `n` is 1, it is already a single subarray, so we can return `True`.\n2. Otherwise, we need to check if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements whose sum is at least `m`. If such a pair exists, we can split the array at that point and continue splitting the resulting subarrays.\n3. If no such pair exists, it is impossible to split the array into `n` subarrays that satisfy the given conditions, so we return `False`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the possibility of splitting the array with a simple linear scan, making it both optimal and easy to understand."

This allows us to consider the smallest limits first, ensuring that we can maximize the number of groups.\n2. **Accumulating Total**: We maintain a running total of the available numbers. For each limit, we add it to the total.\n3. **Checking Feasibility**: For each step, we check if the accumulated total is sufficient to form a group of size `k+1`. The required number of elements to form a group of size `k+1` is given by the triangular number formula `(k+1)*(k+2)//2`.\n4. **Incrementing k**: If the total is sufficient, we increment `k`, indicating that we can form another group.\n5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the value of `k`, which represents the maximum number of groups that can be formed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use the available numbers to form the maximum number of groups while satisfying the given constraints."

If so, return 0 since no subarray of length `k` exists.\n2. **Initial Sum and Frequency Map**: Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements and create a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in this window.\n3. **Check Initial Window**: If the number of distinct elements in the initial window is at least `m`, update `max_sum`.\n4. **Sliding Window**: Slide the window one element at a time. Update the sum by adding the new element and subtracting the element that is left behind. Update the frequency map accordingly.\n5. **Update Maximum Sum**: After each slide, if the number of distinct elements in the current window is at least `m`, update `max_sum`.\n6. **Return Result**: After processing all possible windows, return `max_sum`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum of any almost unique subarray of length `k` using a sliding window technique combined with a frequency map to track distinct elements."

The goal is to minimize the length of the array after performing such operations as many times as possible.\n\n1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing two pointers, `left` and `right`. The `left` pointer starts at the beginning of the array, and the `right` pointer starts at the middle of the array. This is because we want to pair elements from the first half with elements from the second half.\n\n2. **Pairing Elements**: We iterate through the array using the `right` pointer. For each element at the `right` pointer, we check if it can be paired with the element at the `left` pointer. If `nums[left] < nums[right]`, it means we can form a valid pair, so we increment the `left` pointer and the `pairs` count.\n\n3. **Counting Pairs**: The `pairs` count keeps track of how many valid pairs we can form. Each pair reduces the length of the array by 2.\n\n4. **Calculating Result**: Finally, the minimum length of the array after removing all possible pairs is calculated as `n - 2 * pairs`, where `n` is the original length of the array.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum number of pairs that can be removed, thus minimizing the length of the array. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array, making it suitable for large inputs."

This allows us to consider the elements in a sequence where we can adjust them to be the same with minimal operations.\n\n2. **Sliding Window**: We use a sliding window approach to find the maximum frequency. The window represents a subarray where we can make all elements equal to the last element in the window with at most `k` operations.\n\n3. **Calculating Operations**: For each window, we calculate the total number of operations required to make all elements in the window equal to the last element. This is done by the formula `(right - left + 1) * nums[right] - total`, where `total` is the sum of the elements in the window.\n\n4. **Adjusting the Window**: If the required operations exceed `k`, we move the left pointer to the right to reduce the window size and the total operations.\n\n5. **Tracking Maximum Frequency**: We keep track of the maximum frequency encountered during the process.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum frequency of any element that can be achieved with at most `k` operations. The complexity is O(n log n) due to sorting, and the sliding window part is O(n), making it suitable for the given constraints."

This is done by iterating through the characters of the strings up to the length of the shortest string and checking if the characters at each position are the same.\n2. **Checking for No Common Prefix**: If there is no common prefix (i.e., the common length is 0), we return -1 because it's impossible to make the strings equal by only deleting characters from the end.\n3. **Calculating Operations**: If there is a common prefix, we calculate the number of operations required to make all strings equal to this common prefix. This is done by summing the differences between the lengths of the original strings and the length of the common prefix.\n4. **Returning the Result**: The total number of operations is returned as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of operations required or correctly identify when it's impossible to make the strings equal."

This helps in determining the intervals where each number appears.\n2. **Merge Intervals**: We then merge overlapping intervals to ensure that no two intervals overlap. This is crucial because overlapping intervals indicate that the same number appears in multiple subarrays, which violates the condition for a good partition.\n3. **Calculate Gaps**: The number of gaps between the merged intervals represents the number of places where we can split the array into subarrays without violating the condition.\n4. **Compute Partitions**: The total number of good partitions is \\(2^{\\text{gaps}}\\), as each gap represents a binary choice: either split or not split at that point.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, we return it modulo \\(10^9 + 7\\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid partitions while handling the constraints effectively."

The array sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.\\nIt can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of possible infection sequences.\\nSince the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.\\nNote that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected with the disease in the beginning.\\n \\nExample 1:\\n\\nInput: n = 5, sick = [0,4]\\nOutput: 4\\nExplanation: Children at positions 1, 2, and 3 are not infected in the beginning. There are 4 possible infection sequences:\\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected since their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 2 gets infected.\\nFinally, the child at position 3 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 2 and 4 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,2,3].\\n- The children at positions 1 and 3 can get infected because their positions are adjacent to the infected children 0 and 4. The child at position 1 gets infected first.\\nNow, the child at position 2 is adjacent to the child at position 1 who is infected and the child at position 3 is adjacent to the child at position 4 who is infected, hence either of them can get infected. The child at position 3 gets infected.\\nFinally, the child at position 2 gets infected because it is adjacent to children at positions 1 and 3 who are infected. The infection sequence is [1,3,2].\\n- The infection sequence is [3,1,2]. The order of infection of disease in the children can be seen as: [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4] => [0,1,2,3,4].\\n- The infection sequence is [3,2,1].

This allows us to efficiently compute combinations using the formula \\( C(n, k) = \\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)!} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Sequences**: We iterate through the `sick` array to determine the lengths of the segments of healthy children between infected children. For each segment, we calculate the number of ways to arrange the infections within that segment using factorials.\n\n3. **Combine Results**: We combine the results from each segment using the combination formula to account for the different ways infections can spread across segments.\n\n4. **Return Result**: The final result is the product of all these values, modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of possible infection sequences while handling the constraints effectively."

To achieve this with the minimum number of additional coins, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Sort the Coins**: Start by sorting the given coins in ascending order. This helps in systematically checking the reachable sums.\n2. **Initialize Variables**: Use `max_reachable` to keep track of the maximum sum that can be obtained with the current set of coins. Initialize `added_coins` to count the number of additional coins needed.\n3. **Iterate Through Coins**: Loop through the sorted coins. For each coin, if it is less than or equal to `max_reachable + 1`, it can be used to extend the range of reachable sums. Update `max_reachable` by adding the coin's value.\n4. **Add Missing Coins**: If the current coin is greater than `max_reachable + 1`, it means there is a gap in the reachable sums. To fill this gap, add a coin of value `max_reachable + 1` and update `max_reachable` accordingly.\n5. **Repeat Until Target is Reached**: Continue the process until `max_reachable` is at least as large as the target.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently cover all sums from 1 to the target with the minimum number of additional coins. The key insight is to always try to extend the reachable sum range by the smallest possible missing value, which is `max_reachable + 1`."

Each set bit represents a bit that needs to be flipped in one of the array elements to achieve the target XOR.\n4. **Return Operations**: The number of set bits is the minimum number of operations required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the necessary bit flips with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`."

This is done by checking both `num - k` and `num + k` in the `prefix_min` dictionary.\n3. **Updating Maximum Sum**: If such a prefix sum exists, we calculate the sum of the subarray and update the maximum sum if this subarray sum is greater than the current maximum.\n4. **Updating Prefix Minimum**: We update the `prefix_min` dictionary to keep track of the minimum prefix sum for each element encountered so far.\n5. **Return Result**: After processing all elements, we return the maximum sum found. If no good subarray is found, we return 0.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum of a good subarray in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs."

Otherwise, -1 is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the best possible pair of gifts while keeping the complexity manageable given the constraints."
